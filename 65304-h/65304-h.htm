<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap"><em>We are arrived at a chief turning-point in
the history of the English highway. New
instruments of locomotion, a greater volume of
traffic, a greater weight in loads, and vastly
increased rapidity in road travel have between
them brought us to an issue: either some very
considerable and immediate change in the character
of the Road, or a serious and increasing handicap
in our rivalry with other nations through the
strain and expense of an out-worn system.</em></p>

<p><em>The moment therefore calls for some examination
of the Road, its theory and history. That
need has prompted me to write this essay; but
I must say at the outset that I approach my task
with no expert qualification. My only equipment
for the general sketch I intend is historical reading
and the experience acquired in the writing of
certain monographs upon the</em> topography <em>of the
Road in the past. I can do no more than suggest
lines of thought which, if they lead to practice,
need a detailed science I do not possess.</em></p>

<p><em>The Road is one of the great fundamental
institutions of mankind. We forget this because
we take it for granted. It seems to be so necessary
and natural a part of all human life that we
forget that it ever had an origin or development,
or that it is as much the creation of man as the
city and the laws. Not only is the Road one of
the great human institutions because it is fundamental
to social existence, but also because its
varied effect appears in every department of the
State. It is the Road which determines the sites
of many cities and the growth and nourishment of
all. It is the Road which controls the development
of strategics and fixes the sites of battles. It is the
Road that gives its frame-work to all economic
development. It is the Road which is the channel
of all trade and, what is more important, of all
ideas. In its most humble function it is a necessary
guide without which progress from place to place
would be a ceaseless experiment; it is a sustenance
without which organized society would be impossible;
thus, and with those other characters
I have mentioned, the Road moves and controls all
history.</em></p>

<p><em>A road system, once established, develops at its
points of concentration the nerve centres of the
society it serves; and we remark that the material
rise and decline of a state are better measured by
the condition of its communications&mdash;that is, of its
roads&mdash;than by any other criterion.</em></p>

<p><em>The construction, the trace, and the whole
character of the Road change with new social
needs and habits, with the facilities of natural
science, their rise and decline. But this perpetual
change, which affects the Road as it does architecture
and every other work of man, is specially
marked by certain critical phases, one of which, as
I said at the opening of this, we have now entered.
There are moments in the history of the Road in
any society where the whole use of it, the construction
of it, and its character have to be transformed.
One such moment, for instance, was when
the wheeled vehicle first appeared: another when
there first appeared large organized armies. It
occurred whenever some new method of progression
succeeded the old. It occurred at similar critical
turning-points in the history of the Road not only
when any of these things arose, but also when they
declined or disappeared. The appearance of great
cities, their sudden expansion or their decay, or the
new needs of a new type of commerce&mdash;and its
disappearance&mdash;bring a whole road system to one
of these revolutionary points. We have had (as
I shall develop in more detail)</em> five <em>great moments
of this kind in the history of the English road
system: the moment when the British trackway
was superseded by the Roman military road; the
moment when the latter declined in the Dark
Ages; the moment when the mediaeval system of
local roads grew up on the basis of the old Roman
trunk roads and around them; the moment when
this in its turn declined in the later sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries; and the re-casting of the
road system by the turnpikes of the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries. To-day the sixth great
change is upon us.</em></p>

<p><em>It is incumbent upon us then to-day to get ourselves
clear upon the theory and the history of the
Road, and I propose in this essay to take them in
two sections: first, the Road in general; next,
that special institution the English Road.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The British Reinforced Concrete Engineering
Co. Ltd. recently became acquainted with the
fact that Mr. Hilaire Belloc was engaged in the
production of an essay on the history of British
Roads. In numerous writings Mr. Belloc has
treated various aspects of Road history, and his
learning on the subject and his method of communicating
it are in high repute among wide
circles of readers. He is, in fact, an outstanding
literary authority on the topic. It therefore
seemed to the Company that if they could
acquire the copyright of the work, in which Mr.
Belloc was treating the whole subject not indirectly,
but directly and systematically, and if
they could issue this work to people who are professionally
engaged in the construction of roads,
a very considerable service would be done to
the cause of road development in the country.
The future always becomes a little clearer if we
thoroughly understand the past, and the Company
feel that everybody who is giving much
of his mind and life to road problems will
be glad to have in his possession a book which
brings out the historical and social, not to say
the romantic, interest which lies beneath the
surface of the English highway. Mr. Belloc
was accordingly approached on the subject and
agreed to sell the publishing rights of his work
to the British Reinforced Concrete Engineering
Co. Ltd., who now have great pleasure in
issuing it to the surveying and civil engineering
profession, believing that it will at once assist
and beguile the work of those to whose hands
the future of the English Roads, and with it
much of the economic and social prosperity of
the country, is largely entrusted.</p>

<p class="chapblock"><em>How Did the Road Come Into Existence: The Experimental
or the Scientific Method: The Haphazard Road:
The Case for Design in Road Construction.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">In order to understand any matter, especially
if we have to understand it for a practical
end, we must begin by the theory of the
thing: we must begin by thinking out why
and how it has come into existence, what its
function is, and how best it can fulfil that
function. Next we must note its effect, once it
is formed, and the results of the fulfilment of its
function.</p>

<p>What then, to begin with, is the origin of
the Road? Why did this human institution
come into existence, and how does it tend to
develop? How may it best be designed to
fulfil its function?</p>

<p>When we have decided that we can go on to
the next point, which is: how does the Road,
once formed, react upon its environment; what
physical and (much more important) political
results flow from its existence?</p>

<p>The answer to the first question, “How did
that human institution, the Road, come into
existence, and why?” is simple, and will be<span id="Page_4" class="pagenum">[4]</span>
given in much the same terms by anyone to
whom it is addressed. The Road is an instrument
to facilitate the movement of man between
two points upon the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>If the surface of the earth were uniform in
quality and in gradient&mdash;that is, if it were of the
same stuff everywhere, of the same degree of
moisture everywhere, and everywhere level&mdash;the
Road between any two points would clearly
be a straight line (to be accurate, the arc
of a great circle) joining those two points. For
when we say that the Road exists “in order to
facilitate” travel over the surface of the earth
from one point to another the word “facilitate”
includes, of course, rapidity in progression,
and the straight line is the shortest line
between any two points.</p>

<p>But the surface of the earth is highly diversified
in quality as in gradient. Therefore the
<em>trajectory</em> or <em>course</em> of the Road is not in practice,
and should not be in theory, a straight line from
point to point. That straight line has to be
modified if we are to give to the Road an ultimate
form such that it shall best serve its end;
and when we come to look into the problem we
shall see that it is one of very great complexity
indeed. That is where the study of the theory
even in its most elementary form becomes of
such value to the execution in practice. We discover
by studying the theory of the Road how<span id="Page_5" class="pagenum">[5]</span>
many and how varied are the elements of the
formula we have to establish. We become prepared
in that study for the discovery, in each
new particular problem, of any number of novel
modifications not present in problems previously
attacked.</p>

<p>So true is this that the whole history of progress
in road-making is a history of discovering
methods for dealing with obstacles either novel
in character or only appreciated after lengthy
use. Let us begin at the beginning, with the
very elements of the affair.</p>

<p>The first element in the theory of the Road
may be put thus: <em>To find a formula of minimum
expense in energy for communication between two
given geographical points under given conditions
of travel and carriage.</em></p>

<p>The diversity of geographical circumstance
moulds the formula into its final shape through
balanced modifications of the direct line.</p>

<p>The most obvious modifications to a direct
trajectory arise from the two primary circumstances
of surface and gradient. It is easier to go
over one kind of soil than another; easier to go
over one kind of surface in summer and another
in winter; easier to go over one kind of surface
in wet, and another in dry weather; easier to
go over one kind of surface with a heavy load and
another with a light load; over one with sumpter
animals, over another on wheels, and so on.</p>

<p><span id="Page_6" class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p><a id="Ref_gradient"></a>Again, it is for all kinds of travel easier to go
upon the flat than uphill, and this element of
gradient is much more complicated than at first
it would appear. Thus travel of one kind&mdash;travel
on foot, for instance&mdash;can take a sharp
gradient for the sake of a short trajectory more
easily than can traffic with burdens; and traffic
with burdens carried by animals can take a
sharper gradient with advantage than can
wheeled traffic; and wheeled traffic differs
according to the character of the vehicle in this
respect.</p>

<p>Again, a road of diverse use must strike a
compromise in its formula between the various
needs subserved. If the great bulk of its use is
to provide for rapid military advance by
marches, you must sacrifice to shortness some of
the easier gradients which would be demanded
for traffic mainly civilian, yet if of three main
users even the least important is incapable of
more than a given gradient, your formula can
never exceed that gradient, and so forth. So we
have even in this simplest and most primary of
all analyses of the Road considerable elements
of complexity appearing.</p>

<p>As the study progresses an indefinite series of
further complexities arises, and one soon reaches
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux</i> in the theory of the Road which has
led to so much discussion and which some still
call unsolved: whether the formula of the Road<span id="Page_7" class="pagenum">[7]</span>
is best left to the unconscious or half-conscious
action of experiment, which in time should lead
to an exact minimum of expense in energy, or
whether it is best to arrive at it by a fully conscious,
exact, and (as we say to-day) “scientific”
examination of all the conditions and a deliberate
and immediate conclusion upon them.</p>

<p>Should the road <em>grow</em> or should it be <em>planned</em>?
The discussion is not idle. The clash of opinion
upon it is at the root of the contrast between
national systems, and a right answer will make
all the difference between success and failure in
our approach to a new road system such as is
now upon us.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>I maintain that of the two theories the second
is just: that a gradual experimental growth in
its roads, a method coincident with local caprice,
burdens with imperfect communication the
society adopting it; that conscious design is
essential to efficiency. And this <a href="#Sketch_I">I propose to
illustrate by a single example</a>. Take two points
A and B, such that a line joining them must lead
across a marsh, a river, and a range of hills.
Let some primitive wanderer make his way from
A to B, knowing, when he is at A, the direction
of B by, let us say, a distant peak overtopping
the range between. That primitive wanderer
would first of all skirt about the marsh and,<span id="Page_9" class="pagenum">[9]</span>
finding its narrowest place at C, would set to
work and make his causeway there. Having
crossed it, he would come to the river. He must
either swim or ford it. Supposing him to prefer,
through the necessity of a pack or what not, to
ford it, he casts about for a ford. He finds one
at D, and perhaps he also, if he takes time to
look about him, finds another deeper one at E
and another at F, but as his causeway is near D
he takes that ford.</p>

<div id="Sketch_I" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Sketch I.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then he has to make for the hills. We will
suppose that the peak directing him from
beyond B is still visible. He takes his new
direction from it and looks towards the base of
the hills at G. There, in the direct line to the
peak, the contours are so steep that the trouble
of getting up would more than counterbalance
the shortness of the cut. He casts about for a
better chance, and at last finds a gradient just
worth his while at H. He climbs up that; but
though the gradient is easy on the A side at H
on the far side it is very difficult, so he turns
along the ridge to K, where he finds an easier
down gradient: a spur leads him on by its
gentle slope, and from the bottom of the spur
he makes straight for B, which is now right in
front of him and plain sailing.</p>

<p>Now, look at that track as established by our
primitive wanderer and see how lengthy and
inconvenient it is, how ill fulfilling the object of<span id="Page_10" class="pagenum">[10]</span>
the traveller compared with what would have
been established by even a moderately intelligent
and cursory survey of the ground as a
whole and the making of a plan. To begin with,
it would have paid our traveller to take a little
more trouble in crossing the rather wider gap in
the marsh at L and the rather deeper ford at F,
because he would have gained very much in
time and space with comparatively slight extra
effort had he surveyed the whole ground and
thought things out. He was only led on to the
ford at D because it was suggested by the crossing
of the marsh at C. The first opportunity
made the second. But to continue the plan:
F is nearly opposite the easier up gradients of
the hills, but, having surveyed that bad steep on
the far side, he slightly modifies his road, crossing
the ridge at M behind a summit which hid
this way from the first traveller. Then he goes
down the practicable, though steep, slope at N,
and so reaches B. The first road produced haphazard
by successive chances gives the lengthy
and roundabout trajectory A&mdash;C, D, H, K&mdash;B.
The second, with very little extra labour, gives
him the far shorter and better trajectory A&mdash;L,
F, M, N&mdash;B.</p>

<p>We see from this elementary example how
the thinking out of the theory of the Road is
of advantage in practice. It may be urged that
the discovery of advantages as time goes on<span id="Page_11" class="pagenum">[11]</span>
gradually improves the Road, and in this way
half-conscious development will always give
you the best road in the long run without
studying its theory. But history is against that
view. Europe is full of roads thus established
haphazard, confirming themselves by use and by
expenditure, and for centuries neglecting opportunities
which would have been present to
the eye of the most cursory and moderately
intelligent survey.</p>

<p>This conflict of principle between <em>growth</em> and
<em>design</em> in the creation of the Road is at the root
of half our modern crises in road-making. The
real issue is between those who would gradually
add to or develop from custom and those who
would radically impose new plans, and on a
right decision the economic future of this
country may well depend.</p>

<p>When we come to consider even the first of
succeeding modifications we see still more clearly
the complexity of any road-formulæ and the
corresponding advantage of plan over habit.
The marsh, the river, and the hill are but the
beginning of the affair. There is a modification
due to the fact that the marsh may not be
permanent, nor the depth of the river; that the
Road may be of special use at moments when the
river is shallow or flooded, when the marsh is
dry or, exceptionally, impassable. There is the
modification of surface. Clay, for instance, is<span id="Page_12" class="pagenum">[12]</span>
fairly good going in dry weather, but the worst
in wet. There is the modification due to vegetation:
the balancing of the effort involved in
going round a dense scrub against that of
cutting through it and of maintaining the
cutting when it is established. There is the
modification introduced by the instruments and
science available for construction and for cutting.
In one stage of development it will pay to
take a road by a bridge across a deep river where
in earlier stages of development it would have
been necessary to seek a ford. In one stage of
development it would pay to make a cutting
through a scar too steep to climb where, in a
lower civilization, it would have paid to go
round it. The whole formula increases in complexity
the more we examine it. It is a formula
for the discovery of a minimum of effort. But
in the establishment of that minimum you have
to consider not only a very great number of
factors, but the respective value of each to the
whole, and your success in establishing the Road
depends upon the accuracy of your judgment
both as to the presence and as to the comparative
value of all those factors.</p>

<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">So much for the first principle of all: that the
Road, like all other human institutions, is
best made with brains, and for that second
immensely valuable, but too often forgotten,
political principle: that if you begin by making
your thing wrong it is likely to take root and
to remain wrong.</p>

<p>A catalogue of the more important physical
factors modifying the formula of the Road (I
will come to the political and economic in a
moment) is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Marsh to be traversed; water courses to be
traversed; differences of surface other than
marsh and water courses; gradients to be

<p>To these five one may add a factor common to
all, and to the making of every road, even in its<span id="Page_14" class="pagenum">[14]</span>
most primitive stages: (6) the proximity of
material (meaning by “proximity” the congeries
of all the factors which make for the
cheapness of material, for the advantage of
using it in a particular place).</p>

<p>Let us take these physical points in their
order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>ii</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span> It is not always appreciated that
the chief obstacle to travel from the beginning
of time has been and still remains marsh, which
may be defined as soil too sodden for travel, as
distinguished from the lands which are boggy
in wet weather but passable. Marsh is less
striking to the eye, especially to the modern eye,
than a stretch of water, much less striking than
the apparent obstacle of the sea, or of a bold hill
range: it is nevertheless the chief problem presented
to the making of a road, because of all
natural obstacles <em>it is the only one wholly untraversable
by unaided man</em>. Man unaided can
climb hills, swim water, work his way through
dense undergrowth. But marsh is <em>impassable</em> to
him: it is the great original obstacle to progress.
If this has not been recognized in the
past, and is still little recognized, it is not only
because marsh is less striking to the eye than
water or hills, but still more because, the original<span id="Page_15" class="pagenum">[15]</span>
roads established by man in forming his cities,
markets, and all the rest of it, being compelled
to avoid marsh, we do not often come across the
problem even to-day. Partly, also, because very
extensive marsh is a rare phenomenon, especially
in Western Europe.</p>

<p>But if we look at the map and at history
we shall see what that obstacle means. It
was marsh which cut off Lancashire from
the South of England, and left Lancashire the
stronghold of old institutions, especially after
the Reformation. It was the marsh of the
Lower Thames estuary, now upon the right,
now upon the left bank of the river, which
forbade a crossing below London. It was marsh
which protected the growth of Venice at the
earliest and most dangerous moment of its existence.
It was marsh which cut off the Western
(Polish) civilization from the Eastern (Russian)
civilization, and was the main geographical cause
of that sharp division in culture which has affected
the whole of later European history. We may
say that the Russian Orthodox Church and the
last Revolution would neither have been, save
for the Pinsk Marshes. To take lesser examples,
we can see to-day the way in which even our
modern ways avoid marsh. The large district
of Gargano in Southern Italy has remained
largely isolated through marsh upon its flanks.</p>

<p>You may see all over Europe, and even in this<span id="Page_17" class="pagenum">[17]</span>
well-drained country, primitive roads deflected
through marsh as they are not by any other
obstacle, and this deflection stamps our road
system to this day, in spite of our enormously
increased opportunities of road construction.
We shall see on a later page the way in which
marsh deflected in the dark ages Roman roads
at the river crossings in this island.</p>

<p>If a special example be required of a road
having grown up and remained on an uneconomic
trajectory on account of marsh moulding
its earlier history, <a href="#Sketch_II">one of the best in England
is that of the Arundel road south of Pulborough</a>.
Seawards from Pulborough (a landing and crossing-place
on the upper River Arun of great
antiquity) the next considerable inhabited spot
was the port and fortified spur of Arundel. The
distance as the crow flies is a short day’s march
or less, some ten miles. Now, the road could
have been taken in a fairly direct line and everywhere
upon the level had it not been for marsh.
The marshes bordering the Arun prevented
such a construction in early times: the road had
to keep to a high, dry bank, then to climb right
up to the top of the Downs and fall again upon
Arundel. So it remained&mdash;having taken root&mdash;through
all the advances in science: so it still
stands to-day. The railway takes the obvious
line, but the road, established centuries ago,
remains on its former trajectory, climbs up<span id="Page_18" class="pagenum">[18]</span>
many hundreds of feet, and then drops down
again to Arundel, involving in the short distance
of ten miles gradients of one in eight and
heavy hill-climbing over more than half the
distance. A neighbouring example of the
extreme importance of <em>the first experiment</em> in the
history of a road is seen at Bramber, in the next
valley eastward. There a similar situation&mdash;the
approach landwards from the port of Shoreham&mdash;avoids
the hills, because at some unknown
but very early period a causeway was built at
Bramber to negotiate the marsh; and that was
because the isolated hill at Bramber afforded
such a good opportunity of fortification and
blocking the pass that a road was bound to reach
it, and even under primitive conditions men
were at the labour of making an embankment.</p>

<h3>iii</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Water Courses.</span> The crossing of water
courses does not seem to have been originally <em>in
the main</em> a search for a ford. It seems to have
been rather a search for <em>good taking-off places
upon either side, however deep the water in
between</em>. The ford was used, of course, wherever
it could be, and in it also the hardness of the
passage under water was of even more importance
than the depth of water: below, say, 4 feet.
But the point to note is that often, and probably
in the majority of cases, man in the early times<span id="Page_19" class="pagenum">[19]</span>
took his short cut across water either by swimming
or by taking advantage of floating
material, and was much more concerned with
the hard bank upon either side than with the
depth of the stream.</p>

<p>If you take such a very old road as that of the
primitive British trackway whose two branches,
from Stonehenge and Winchester, unite in
what is called the “Pilgrim’s Way” and make
for the Straits of Dover, you find this trackway
crossing the Mole, the Wey, and the Medway,
as also the Darenth, at places where the obvious
consideration has been a dry approach upon
either side, and not the local shallowness of the
stream. (We must remember in this connection
that the word “ford” is used at plenty of places
where the stream is too deep for crossing on
foot: it means simply “a going.” A false
etymology here has misled many historians.)
Of more importance to the first makers of the
Road than the depth of a water course was its
swiftness. We have in this country few examples
of swift streams of any magnitude, and none of
streams so swift as to be impassable or passable
with great difficulty, but where such examples
occur abroad it is easy to see what a boundary
and obstacle a rapid current afforded. It works
in all manner of ways to the disadvantage of
travel, it makes both swimming and ferrying
more difficult (or impossible), it makes bridging<span id="Page_20" class="pagenum">[20]</span>
either more difficult or (in early times) impossible,
it usually connotes great differences of
level, sudden floods, etc., and it also usually connotes
changes and variety of currents, as well as
the destruction of the banks.</p>

<p>At an early stage in the development of the
Road came the use of the bridge, and with the
bridge the original chief consideration&mdash;a dry
approach from either side&mdash;was emphasized.
It is true that fords were bridged as roads developed,
but the bridging of a ford is not the
normal origin of the bridge. The normal origin
of the bridge, if we judge by any one of the
original great roads of Europe, is the replacing
of a ferry. Men took the obstacle of a river (on
account of its length) as something hardly to be
turned, save perhaps in its higher reaches. They
made straight for it, seeking only firm ground
from which to embark and disembark, and
established a boat crossing. To <em>this</em> rather than
to the ford the bridge succeeded. They bridged
it with increasing success as their material
science increased in power, and you may see
all over Europe the great bridges thrown, not
where the river was shallowest nor where it was
easiest to traverse for any other reason, but
chiefly where the main road led. In other
words, the bridge is a function of the Road
rather than the Road of the bridge.</p>

<p>Two outstanding examples of this in Europe<span id="Page_21" class="pagenum">[21]</span>
are London Bridge, perhaps prehistoric, certainly
not much less than two thousand years
old, and the bridge at Cologne, to which one
might add the bridge at Rouen and the bridges
of the Island of Paris, which we know to be more
than two thousand years old. But it must be
remembered that the bridging of a river, even
in primitive times, was the next easiest thing to
a ferry, and in some circumstances easier even
than a ferry. A bridge need not be built of
piles. It may be built of boats, and in principle,
even over a broad stream, once you could build
a boat bridge at all you could build it of almost
indefinite length. What would militate against
the effort to make a pile bridge were depth and
rapidity of stream, but even these, unless the
rapidity were very great indeed, did not prevent
the throwing of a bridge of boats.</p>

<p>The bridge as an element in the Road plays
a very large part which needs some detailed
examination: it develops a whole series of results.
The object of a bridge is to give <em>continuity</em> and
<em>security</em> to travel across an obstacle of depth:
usually an obstacle of running water, sometimes
a dry ravine. <em>It is but rarely that a bridge is
essential to the mere trajectory of a road.</em> In much
the greater number of cases its function can be
supplied, though far less perfectly, by a ferry,
or a ford, or a graded way down into and up
from a depression. What the bridge does is to<span id="Page_22" class="pagenum">[22]</span>
permit of continued traffic, especially continued
wheeled traffic, across such obstacles without
delay and without trans-shipment, and at the
same time to add, up to a maximum of weight,
to security; for it is obviously an instrument
more secure than the ferry or the ford, especially
for heavy weights.</p>

<p>But the bridge has always represented a
special economic effort, greater yard for yard
than that of the average of the road of which it
was a part; and that is why you almost always
find it the mark of civilization. A primitive
culture can exist for centuries without bridges.
The proportion of bridge-building effort to
road-building effort varies very much with the
physical science of various times. It is less to-day,
and was less in Roman times, than in
primitive times and in the Middle Ages, because
we, like the Roman engineers, expend a far
greater economic effort upon the average of the
Road, so that the comparative cost of the bridge
is less. In primitive times the bridge was something
of a feat, its construction as measured in
effort was equivalent to many miles of road, its
builder a public benefactor, and its building an
event of note. This is so true that in some
languages which have come down but little
changed from primitive times the word for
“bridge” is found to be a foreign word, as
though the institution were not sufficiently<span id="Page_23" class="pagenum">[23]</span>
common before the advent of some civilized
conqueror to have acquired a special name; and
in all primitive societies the bridge is rare.</p>

<p>This comparatively high cost of the bridge
has had certain effects on the history and in the
appearance of our roads which are worth noting.
In the first place, the bridge tends to be a “gut.”
When the throwing of a bridge was equivalent
in expense to several miles of the existing road
it was a great saving to make it narrow: only
one vehicle to pass at a time, with side refuges
at the piles when the passage of two vehicles in
opposing directions was unavoidable.</p>

<p>Again, bridges tended, especially in times of
low economic development, to introduce a
sudden high gradient. The elliptical arch was,
if not unknown, at any rate very rare before the
Renaissance, and where the plain semi-circular
arch alone was used a flat bridge involved, if
the crossing were of any width, a great number
of piles, and therefore an added expense. The
difficulty was met in the majority of cases by
lessening the number of piles, especially towards
the centre, where there was a greater depth,
consequently increasing the span there, and
consequently, in a semi-circular arch, increasing
its height correspondingly. The result was that
the bridge introduced a sudden hillock into the
Road, and that feature you find all over Western
Europe up to quite modern times, with many<span id="Page_24" class="pagenum">[24]</span>
survivals remaining, especially in Spain. In
some of the very early bridges in the poorer
districts, or on the less used roads, the exaggeration
is fantastic. I know of one over the
Gallego, near Huesca, where the pitch is so
steep that it baulks a car.</p>

<p>There were particular structures&mdash;that of
London is an example in point&mdash;where the disadvantage
of a gradient was avoided at great
expense because a mass of traffic and merchandise
made it worth while. London Bridge
was carried on a great number of arches precisely
in order to avoid this element of gradient.
A side-effect of this was the blocking of the
stream and great difficulty for boats in “shooting”
the arches on a tide; but this drawback
to river traffic was thought worth while as the
price of a level road.</p>

<p>Another reason which often led to the expensive
flat stone bridge was its replacing an old
wooden pile bridge. The wooden pile bridge
had no cause for creating a gradient. On the
whole it was cheaper to keep it exactly level, and
as low as possible consistent with the rise of the
water. Where such a structure had preceded a
stone bridge the habit of a level road was continued,
even at the expense of many piles and
arches.</p>

<p>A third effect of the bridge upon the Road, also
due to its comparative expense, was the convergence<span id="Page_25" class="pagenum">[25]</span>
of roads towards bridges, established
or even only planned. You will perpetually
find up and down Europe the approaches to a
town from two or more directions merged into
a common road just at the entry to a bridge, in
order to save the expense of two crossings,
though at an extra expense of space and time;
thus, Abbeville, Caen (a very striking example,
with <em>three</em> converging roads on each side of the
bridge), London&mdash;the chief example in Europe&mdash;Saragossa,
with the two main roads from
south and west converging on its bridge&mdash;all
“gather” roads after this fashion.</p>

<p>But the effects of the bridge upon the mere
trajectory of a road, upon its surface and contour,
were far less than were its political and
military effects. Though land armies were
always tied to roads more or less, it was possible
to leave the road for short distances under stress
or for the sake of strategy. Cavalry continually
did so for great stretches, and infantry could do
so occasionally. But a bridge acted like a
magnet. The defence of a bridge was the
defence of a point which an army in force was
always compelled to use, and the term “bridge
head”&mdash;that is, the holding of the space on the
<em>further</em> side of the bridge, thus commanding
the passage&mdash;is an example of its permanent
military function.</p>

<p>A bridge was, for the same reason, a natural<span id="Page_26" class="pagenum">[26]</span>
place of toll. Merchandise had to use it, and the
same requirement of continual repair which
often entailed a permanent post at a bridge gave
the opportunity for using that post for the
raising of taxation. All through the end of the
Roman Empire and the Dark and Middle Ages
this function of the bridge is most prominent.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>But most important of all the effects of the
bridge is its creation of a <em>nodal point</em>, that is, a
knot or crossing of ways. The bridge effects this
in two fashions: firstly by that tendency to a convergence
of roads upon the bridge which I have
just noted, and secondly, and much more important,
by the transverse of the bridge and the
river. A river is also a high road if it is in any
way navigable. Therefore, wherever a land road
crosses a river and establishes a bridge you get
a crossways of communications. At such a point,
where many avenues of approach meet, and
whence opportunities of travel to different places
radiate, you have what is called in political
geography a Nodal Point.</p>

<div id="Ref_27" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Icknield Street</span> in
the Oxfordshire Chilterns</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now, the nodal point is of such importance
that it merits particular attention. The nodal
point, especially if it is established by a bridge,
has two great functions in history. It determines
the strategy of campaigns (and alters even
the tactics of actions), it determines the growth<span id="Page_29" class="pagenum">[29]</span>
of towns. It has been said that London was
made by its bridge. Whether there was a
settlement (there probably was) upon the
gravelly hill which approached the river from
the north, before any bridge was thrown across
the tidal Thames, we do not know; but it is
certain that the throwing of this bridge gave
London its opportunity for development, and
what is true of London is true of Paris, of Rouen,
of Maestricht, of Cologne, and of twenty other
great urban centres in our civilization. Strategically,
a commander holding a nodal point
retains the opportunity of moving along any
one of many lines of movement, and at the same
time denies the opportunity of junction to his
enemies. To put it in its simplest form, a commander
holding a nodal point and concentrated
there can prevent the concentration of two
fractions of his enemy along any two roads
radiating from that nodal point. He can himself
march up each of these consecutively and
defeat the two fractions of his enemy in detail.
That is the simplest possible case, and it can be
developed into any amount of detail and intricacy.</p>

<p>The bridge is the point where the commerce
up and down stream crosses the road-commerce
transversely to the river-commerce, and the
nodal point of the bridge establishes a market.
But that nodal point has other characters even<span id="Page_30" class="pagenum">[30]</span>
more important to civilian life. It creates a
point of <em>trans-shipment</em>, where goods must be
transferred from the water vehicle to the land
vehicle. In their transference you have the
political opportunity of examination and toll,
and, if necessary, interception; and you also
have, of course, the whole of the middleman
business of dealing with and passing through
the goods&mdash;you have the depot and the warehousing
and all the adjuncts of a built-up commercial
centre and a market.</p>

<p>But the bridge as a nodal point has yet
another occasional function which has marked
all history. That function it exercises when it
is the lowest bridge upon a great navigable
river. Such a bridge&mdash;the bridge of Rome for
instance, the bridge of London, the bridge of
Gloucester, the bridge of Newcastle, etc.&mdash;has
been the making of inland ports. It must be
remembered that before the advent of the railway,
or at any rate before the organization of
rapid and easy road travel, it was to the interest
of sea-borne trade to penetrate into the heart of
the country as far as possible. You avoided the
cost of trans-shipment, and you had a much
cheaper means of conveyance than anything
that went by land. But the first permanent
bridge across a waterway blocked the further
progress up-stream of sea-borne traffic. Therefore
there was a tendency to keep this first<span id="Page_31" class="pagenum">[31]</span>
bridge well up-stream. Further, whenever it
was made, it tended to create a glut of traffic at
this point of section. The cargoes from the sea
came here and could go no further, and this
last function of the bridge is perhaps of all its
historical functions the most important. Even
where a river is very rapid, as the Tiber, the
first bridge has some effect. Where it is tidal it
is, of course, as in the cases we have just quoted,
of the greatest effect, and usually on the great
tidal waterways the first bridge will be found
not indeed at the limit of the tide, for there the
water would be too shallow, but in the last
reaches. There are cases (Rochester is one)
where the road has proved more important than
the stream, where a bridge was imposed very
low down in the tideway, but it has there fulfilled
the same function of creating a market and a
town. There are cases (Antwerp, Bordeaux, and
Philadelphia are examples) where a secure harbour
and good wharfage made the inland market
and town in the absence of such an obstacle
as the first bridge; but in the greater number of
navigable rivers, even in so narrow a stream as
that of Seville, the bridge makes the port and
the town, as one can see by adding to the
examples already given Nantes, Montreuil,
Glasgow, etc.</p>

<p>There is a little note on the crossing of water
courses which is curious and interesting in the<span id="Page_32" class="pagenum">[32]</span>
history of roads. Since the crossing is always an
effort, or, in economic terms, an expense, to be
avoided as much as possible, the Road naturally
avoids a <em>double crossing</em>, but, on the other hand,
an island is a stronghold, and even a peninsula
where two rivers meet is a potential stronghold.
Therefore you have in the history of all early
European roads a sort of dilemma, the first
travellers debating, as it were, whether the
occasion were sufficiently important to warrant
the double crossing of the stream. At Reading,
Lyons, Melun, notably at Paris, and in dozens
of other places, the presence of the stronghold
made it worth while for the Road to visit the
place in spite of the double crossing, whether to
an island or to the meeting of two streams. But
in much the majority of cases the Road was
deflected from its simplest line to a point below
the meeting of two streams so as to avoid the
double effort, and the occasion explains many
a deflection which otherwise would seem to have
no reason.</p>

<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">To the next physical factor modifying the
formula of the Road we have given the
name: <span class="smcap">Differences of Surface other
than Marsh and Water Courses</span>. The differences
of surface other than marsh or water courses
affect the trajectory of a road in several ways:
first and originally in its passability to human
travel on foot or with beasts of burden, or later
with wheeled vehicles, and here the two factors
were hardness and evenness. But there was a
great contrast in the obstacles of the North and
the South of our civilization. In the North, and
especially in England, damp was the enemy.
For a trajectory to be used in all seasons and in
all weather sand and chalk at once suggested
themselves. Clay can be used only in the dry
season. The various soils determined the first
trackway and impose themselves visibly upon
the map of our oldest roads.</p>

<p>For instance, the road down the upper Wey<span id="Page_34" class="pagenum">[34]</span>
to Farnham is, in its oldest form, a deliberate
picking out of long gravelly stretches in the bed
of the valley. On a geological map you can
trace this road picking its way from gravel
patch to gravel patch almost as a man crosses a
stream by stepping stones. It leaps, as it were,
from one gravelly stretch to another, and in
each keeps to the gravel as long as it can.
For the same reason a primitive road will
follow the South, or sunny, side of a wood or of
a ridge of land, so that the surface may dry as
soon as possible after rain.</p>

<p>When the use of artificial material for the
surface of the track became common this
question of quality of soil was somewhat modified,
but its essential was retained; for what
made bad going (in the North, and particularly
in Britain) being heavy soil, that same kind of
land, which interfered with foot or pack-horse
travel, swallowed up material. It was a less
grave inconvenience than in the times before
artificial material was used, but it was still
an inconvenience expressed in the shape of
expense; and nearly all the original trackways
continued to take account of this factor long
after the use of artificial material had been introduced.
The earliest of all, of course, follow the
dry ridges, and in particular the chalk.</p>

<p>One may say, with slight exaggeration, that
the chalk was the essential factor in the building<span id="Page_35" class="pagenum">[35]</span>
up of British communications before the Roman
civilization came. If you take a geological map
of England you may see the great chalk ridges
radiating in a sort of whorl from a centre in
Salisbury Plain, and providing dry going to the
Channel, the Straits of Dover, and across the
Thames valley at Streatley right on to Norfolk.</p>

<p>Another example of a road taking advantage
of dryness of surface is the straight line leading
to Lincoln northwards, everywhere following
that peculiar isolated ridge, with low-lying
ground upon the left and marsh upon the right.
Another very striking one is the Hog’s Back,
where from one low-lying point to another
(Guildford to Farnham) the primitive track
deliberately rises and follows the summit of a
high hill between rather than the wetter ground
upon the slopes, though here there is an alternative
upon the southern, or sunny, slope where
the trackway leads through to St. Catherine’s
Chapel. This is a modern example of the way
in which a primitive track imposes itself upon
posterity. To this day your motorist climbs up
that roof of a house out of Guildford and goes
down the steep on to Farnham because countless
generations ago his ancestor could only be
certain upon that height of dry ground.</p>

<p>In the South (which does not concern this
essay) the great obstacle in the way of soil is not
marsh, but sand. That is something of which<span id="Page_36" class="pagenum">[36]</span>
we have here no experience, but the tracks of
nearly all Western Islam are dependent upon it.
Drift sand is not so impassable as marsh by any
means, but it is terrible going. North and
South of Atlas the knowledge of how this kind
of soil may be avoided is half the business of
establishing a primitive road.</p>

<p>An interesting case of surface (but one which
is rarely met with in this country) common in
dry countries where the rare rainfall is sudden
and intense, and where temporary water courses
carve out the friable soil, is the inconvenience
due to what are called in some parts of the East
“nullahs”&mdash;that is, the dry beds of such water
courses or the sudden depressions made by what
were formerly water courses now dried up
through a change of climate. The banks of
these are often so steep and their depth so considerable
that the making of a plain, straight
trajectory across such a country would, even
under modern conditions, not be worth the
labour expended. It would mean continual
bridging, or continual embankment. One of the
effects of this type of surface is the inordinate
winding of all the roads, and even, alternatively,
the absence of roads perpendicular to the fall of
the land, and the establishment of communications
along the line of fall rather than across it.
One can see this very conspicuously in Morocco,
where there are whole districts, a couple of<span id="Page_37" class="pagenum">[37]</span>
days’ march across, the trails of which are determined
by this accident. A special example of
the same kind of thing is to be found in any hill
range where a number of narrow spurs project
towards the plain. The Road hardly ever runs
parallel to the range across these spurs. It nearly
always runs down the valleys or along the plain
at their foot, and that although there be, as
there usually are, in each valley centres of
population which need to be linked up with the
neighbouring parallel valleys.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gradients.</span> The obstacle of gradient the
“minimum of vertical effort” is the most evident
of all the factors which modify the trajectory of a
road; yet it is, upon the whole, the most complex.
To determine the minimum of effort you
have to find a formula consisting of many
factors, <a href="#Ref_gradient">some of which I have already enumerated
in the opening words of this essay</a>. In the
first place, you have to consider the <em>average</em>
nature of the travel to be served. The Road used
by men on foot without burdens, by men on
foot with burdens, by pack animals, by wheeled
vehicles, etc., must conform itself, on the
whole, to the <em>least</em> gradient useful to those who
travel by it, but that “on the whole” least
gradient is a factor by no means easy to determine.
It depends not only upon the nature of<span id="Page_38" class="pagenum">[38]</span>
the instruments of travel, but upon habit, upon
vigour, and to some extent upon surface. It
depends also on the proportionate use of the
Road. You cannot sacrifice ninety-nine travellers
to the special weakness of one.</p>

<p>There is also the question of durability. A
primitive road, taking a very steep gradient,
will be more durable than one taking a lesser
gradient round the slopes of a hill and subject
to falls from above and to degradation down the
slope below; it will need less upkeep, for it is
always shorter&mdash;and this last consideration explains
what would otherwise be inexplicable:
the extraordinarily steep gradients which primitive
roads and even the roads of a high civilization
will take.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this in England
is <a href="#Sketch_III">the behaviour of the Fosse Way in the neighbourhood
of Radstock in Somerset</a>. Here the
original road was presumably a prehistoric
track, but we know that it was carefully remodelled
by the high Roman civilization. It
must have been used for the great mass of travel
during four hundred years from the first occupation
of the West of England by the Romans
about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 50 to the breakdown about 450,
and right on into the Dark Ages&mdash;that is, for
not less than one thousand years. During the
first half of this time (and especially during the
first third) it had to carry the travel of a very<span id="Page_39" class="pagenum">[39]</span>
full, well-developed, and complex society to one
of the most important centres of its wealth, the
town of Bath. Yet the road goes up the most
astonishing gradients.</p>

<div id="Sketch_III" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Sketch III</p></div>
</div>

<p>Somehow or other, these gradients were
normally used&mdash;but it is a puzzle to say how.
The modern road has frankly abandoned the
effort, and takes a long sweep round both sides
of the valley at a gradient of about 1 in 12.
Even so, it is quite steep enough for our modern
methods of travel.</p>

<p><span id="Page_40" class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>The question of gradient is complicated,
again, by another variable which makes the
solution of the problem much more intricate
than the discovery of minimum effort upon a
particular gradient. You have to consider not
only the uphill or downhill upon a given slope,
but the type of further uphill and downhill to
which your road, once established on that slope,
is leading you. It is not enough to determine
your best formula under such and such conditions
of travel for overcoming one side of the
obstacle. You have also to ask yourself whether,
having got your best uphill road, you may not
have led the traveller to an impossible position
on the further side. Extreme cases of this one
often sees in the Jura range, where the hills are
shaped like waves in a storm: a steep escarpment
upon the eastern side, very difficult to
go up or down, and an easy slope upon the
western. Here you have to balance the advantage
of your gradient upon the one side with
the advantage of the gradient that you will find
upon the other, and, of course, to direct your
line principally with a view to travel on the
more difficult steeper side. That is why you
often find yourself following in the Jura a road
which goes up the easy western side by an
apparently over-steep trajectory: you wonder
why the road does not take some obviously
easier line which lies below you. The reason<span id="Page_41" class="pagenum">[41]</span>
you only discover upon reaching the summit and
seeing the precipitous escarpment overhanging
the eastern valley&mdash;your road has made for some
exceptional advantage down this cliff, some
cleft, which an easier advance from the west
would not have hit. A balance has to be struck
between the advantage of gradients on both
sides of the hill, save in the rare cases where a
range (such as the Vosges) is symmetrical and
gives you equal gradients upon either slope.</p>

<p>That balance is always a matter of careful
calculation. Where it has been brought to a
fine art is, of course, in surveying for a modern
railroad, for there the slightest differences of
gradient make such a vast difference in the
expense of working that the discovery of a true
minimum over an obstacle of hill country is of
the first importance.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>There is hardly any factor in connection with
the theory of the road which needs more
material modification as civilization changes
than this factor of gradient. The sharpest contrast
in the whole of history is that which I have
just mentioned: that of the railroads. Men
suddenly found themselves possessed of a new
instrument which enormously multiplied their
power on the flat and yet was quite incapable of
anything like the old gradients. Going level or<span id="Page_42" class="pagenum">[42]</span>
on very slight gradients it could give them
travel far more rapid and inexpensive than any
that had been known before, but one in fifty
bothered it badly, one in thirty was wholly unnatural,
and the existing gradients of one in ten,
eight, six, were out of the question. Further,
the least inclination increased all difficulties, and
the addition of inclination produced these difficulties
in more than a geometrical progression.
The result was the revolution whose effects we
see about us everywhere: the tunnel, the cutting,
the embankment.</p>

<p>To-day, a couple of generations after that
revolution, there comes the new problem of the
internal-combustion engine, where the gradient
again appears in a new light.</p>

<p>The motor takes gradients far steeper than
the rail. Its difficulties are not increased in the
same ratio. But it cannot always deal with the
horse road. Lynton and Lynmouth and their
Devonshire valley form perhaps the best example
of this in Great Britain. You have here
terrible gradients which were just possible for
the horse vehicle and are hardly possible for the
motor vehicle, and you have the new road round
by Watersmeet attempting partially, but not
entirely, to solve the problem.</p>

<p>A special case in this general category of
gradients, and one much more complex than
appears at first sight, is the case of the pass, or<span id="Page_43" class="pagenum">[43]</span>
gap. Men have always naturally made for any
notch in a line of hills to save themselves the
effort of higher climbing. It began with foot
travel, and has continued right on throughout
the history of the Road. In high mountains
provided with low passes the use of a saddle
in the range was obvious and often necessary;
but there were disadvantages even in that apparently
unexceptionable rule. One was the
question just dealt with of the double slope:
the consideration of the other side&mdash;the most
obvious pass from the one side did not necessarily
lead to the best descent upon the
other.</p>

<p>Another was the conformation of many
ranges, which is such that the approach to the
ridge is much steeper at the <em>summit</em> of a “col”
or pass than it is by tracks to one side.</p>

<p>This is a paradox which people living in easy
hill-lands have difficulty in appreciating. The
Alps especially show roads which puzzle us
(who are of a gentler landscape) when we
follow them: yet the principle is simple and
dependent upon the geological formation of
most <em>new</em> mountain ranges, which present a
hard core, forming their central ridge. The
softer ground wears away on either side of the
valley: the ridge remains. The effect is that a
<em>direct</em> approach to the notch in the range would
give impossible gradients in the last few hundred<span id="Page_44" class="pagenum">[44]</span>
yards, and therefore the road must gradually
curve round by a side of the valley.</p>

<p>A third exceptional case is that of trajectories
where the minimum of effort is only to be found
by going <em>right over the very summit of the highest
hill in your neighbourhood</em>. Lastly, there is the
curious case of a pass where it is to the advantage
of the road to <em>avoid</em> the lowest passage of the
range and to take a line to one side above it.</p>

<p>As examples of these last two paradoxical
points I may quote the pass of Sallent in the
Pyrenees and the exceedingly important road
<a href="#Sketch_IV">from the valley of the Moselle to the valley of
Belfort in the Vosges</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of the pass of Sallent there was
an obvious notch in the range, which was used
from the very earliest times till just the other
day. It was through this that the armies of the
Moors poured in the eighth century for their
attempted conquest of Europe, when they
invaded France and nearly reached the Loire.
So late as within living memory it was the
regular track from the valley of the Gallego to
that of Gabas. Now, the modern road, after
careful survey, has been constructed to cross the
mountain summit somewhat to the west, and a
good three hundred feet higher than the old
pass. Why was this? It was because the notch
of Sallent had a very steep approach in the last
few hundred yards upon either side, and the<span id="Page_45" class="pagenum">[45]</span>
minimum of effort, at any rate for wheeled
vehicles of the modern type, was found in taking
a lesser gradient to one side, although it involved
a much higher climb. The case of the road
from the Moselle valley to Belfort in the Vosges
is even more remarkable, for one would have
said at first asking that no such case could exist:
one would have said that a minimum of effort
could never be reached by going over the <em>very
highest summit</em> in your neighbourhood, but it is
so when you deal with what I will call a “star”
mountain, as will be seen at once from the
following elements.</p>

<div id="Sketch_IV" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Sketch IV</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here the contours are such that had the road
deflected to the west or the east in order to<span id="Page_46" class="pagenum">[46]</span>
avoid the highest summit, it would have been
compelled either to a very long detour (involving
in any case <em>nearly</em> as high a climb) or to
a series of steep and profound ups and downs
over the spurs of the mountain. The line taken
from the Moselle to Belfort on the other side
goes within a few feet of the highest point on
the hill, and is yet the line of least effort from
one point to the other. It is an excellent example
of the way in which the formula of <em>minimum
effort</em>, when it is thought out, may be quite
different from what mere habit would have
produced.</p>

Skirt Woodlands: Roads which have been Deflected
by Forest: Proximity of Material as a Final Main
Cause Modifying the Trajectory of a Road: Cost of
Transporting Material and its Effects in Ancient and
Modern Times.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The obstacle of vegetation, which is
our next cause modifying the trajectory
of a road, is two-fold. There is the
obstacle presented by forests or permanent
vegetation (which includes in some climates
very high grasses) and the obstacle presented
by intermittent growths. We are not, in this
country and in modern times, well acquainted
with the obstacle of vegetation to a road and
with the modification of trajectory which it imposes.
We have no <em>large</em> forests left: we have,
in common with all Northern Europe, no
exuberance of growth. The dense population
and very high road mileage of modern England
have put this factor in the development of
communication out of sight, and it is so unrecognized
that the mention of it here may
seem superfluous. But it is still a grave element
in the calculation of a road even in the European<span id="Page_48" class="pagenum">[48]</span>
world, and a graver one in the new countries.
And it has had its part in framing our own
system in its earlier stages. In damp tropical
countries it is all important, and even in
temperate climates where large forests exist it
has its place.</p>

<p>(a) <em>Forest.</em> Two special expenditures attach
to this obstacle: First the effort of clearing a
way, second the effort of maintenance, and particularly
through the effect of wood upon surface.
The effort of clearing, always an expense,
made the forest in very early times an insuperable
obstacle to any great or considerable
road. The forest had tracks, but the main road
was compelled to skirt the denser woodland, or at
the least to take a tortuous trajectory for the advantage
of natural clearings. With the development
of civilization that difficulty disappeared,
and it disappeared early, although I can call to
mind no broad primitive track through any dense
woodland. The Roman roads hewed their way
through forests where it was necessary, and found
in the value of the timber felled an economic
compensation for the effort made. But even with
them, and even with modern roads, it remains true
that the forest governs and modifies road construction.
There is case after case where a Roman
road, and even a modern road, will skirt a forest
rather than be at the effort of overcoming the
obstacle: for instance, the case of the forest of<span id="Page_49" class="pagenum">[49]</span>
Mormal in Northern France. Here the main
Roman road from the centre of Northern
Gaul to the crossings of the Rhine cuts along
the edge of the great wood like a knife, with no
growth on its western side. Further, cause and
effect reacting on one another, the lack of roads
preventing clearing, and the lack of clearing
keeping down habitation and so ways, there is
no great forest possessing a system of roads anywhere
in Europe. All considerable stretches of
woodland, where agriculture or other economic
effort has not cleared them, have a minimum of
roadway.</p>

<p>In our northern climate, the larger stuff once
felled, upkeep is not a grave economic matter.
The use of artificial material, which comes in at
the very first stages of road-making, renders the
problem here even less important. But in other
climates, and particularly in the tropics, it
becomes the dominating factor. There are
whole districts&mdash;as, for instance, on the Amazon
basin, or, again, in Central and West Africa&mdash;where
the problem of communication consists
not in the cutting of the original track, expensive
as that is, but in its maintenance; and
in the greater part of those districts even
modern civilization, with its immense material
advantages, and with its strong economic inducement
to the transport of tropical material,
has been unable or unwilling to make and maintain<span id="Page_50" class="pagenum">[50]</span>
forest roads, at any rate for ordinary
wheeled traffic.</p>

<p>With the railways it is otherwise. The
economic effort required for the construction of
the track is such that the added expense of
clearing the forest is a much smaller fraction of
the whole, and the type of bed which has to be
established for the track partially solves (but
only partially) the question of upkeep. Even
the railway can be overcome by the vigour of
tropical vegetation, but it has a better economic
basis in the densely wooded country than has
the Road.</p>

<p>One of the most curious facts in the history of
roads due to the obstacle of wood is the deflection
of the Roman Road through this cause
after the decline of civilization. One can find
many instances of this even in England, light
as is the afforesting of this country, and small
as are the districts affected. Thus the Great
North Road making for Stamford is a broad,
unmistakable way raised high above the neighbouring
country, and looking like some great
double rampart, from the crossing of the
Welland for miles to the north and west. It
approaches a small patch of wood on a hill and
disappears. It remains lost for a mile after its
destruction by the wood, and is not found again
in anything like its earlier sharpness of outline
till Stamford is reached. That is because the<span id="Page_51" class="pagenum">[51]</span>
upkeep through the wood became too difficult
in the Dark Ages, and men turned the obstacle
by developing a new road round it. Another
very clear example is to be found on the Stane
Street north of Eartham, where the great <em>Nore
Wood</em> through which the Roman road was
driven usurped it in later times, overgrew it, and
deflected the modern road round by Duncton
Hill. We have here probably not so much a case
of keeping down the new growth as of the wetness
of the track when artificial material ceased
to be used, and of the difficult going thus made
between the trees. The occasional fall of trees
across the road left unremoved, and the danger
in such times from any close cover must not be
neglected. But, whatever the cause, woodland
perpetually deflects a Roman road after the
breakdown of the old civilization. It deflects it
almost as often as does the marsh of a river
valley.</p>

<p>(b) The obstacle to the making of a road due
to intermittent vegetation is one which plays
no part in our system, and is unknown to our
climatic conditions. Nor is it of any great effect
save in a few special highly characterized regions
of the world. The track, once established, can
commonly keep down even the riot of spring
vegetation in open land. Such exceptions as
there are, due to the exceptional development
of grasses, affect no part of the world where<span id="Page_52" class="pagenum">[52]</span>
communications need high development. The
factor exists, but needs no more than a mention.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>The last main cause modifying the trajectory
of a road is the relative proximity of material for
its construction, using the word “proximity”
in the wider sense to include all economic effort:
what to-day we call the “cheapness” of the
material.</p>

<p>Even in the very simplest and most primitive
form of roadwork material enters. There is
always the necessity of hardening some bit of
soft ground or of smoothing some bit of unevenness,
and from the beginning of travel you
have had the transportation of material to the
established road for the improvement of its
surface, for the bridging of its water obstacles
or flooring of fords, for the making of its causeways
over marshes.</p>

<p>In what may be called the middle period of
road construction&mdash;that is, in periods of high
civilisation, but civilisation not provided with
modern instruments&mdash;the immediate neighbourhood
of material introduced a considerable
modifying factor into the trajectory of a road.
This was often masked, from the fact that the
same soil which provided good going and therefore
developed early tracks usually also provided,
in the nature of things, good material<span id="Page_53" class="pagenum">[53]</span>
for hardening the surface, for the building of
causeways, and even for the throwing of
bridges. It was also masked by the fact that the
bridge, if it were to be built of wood, could get
its material from a considerable distance, as the
river was its avenue of supply. But though transport
of material has gone through a revolution in
the last hundred years, and material for road-making
is now brought half across the world
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i> Colonial wood pavement), yet the way
neighbourhood of material tells can still be seen
everywhere upon the road map of Europe.
Thus the absence of main roads in the Fens for
centuries was not only due to the necessity of
continual artificial work, embankments, and
bridges (this would not have deterred the
Roman road-makers nor the great effort of the
early Middle Ages from attempting a full
network of roads). It was rather due to the
absence of hard material. And you have the
same phenomenon in the Landes of South-western
France, where to this day only one
great road serves an immense district whose
loose and sandy soil fails to provide a cheap and
sufficient material. The traveller in Holland
notices the same thing: here are roads ultimately
depending upon brick paving and
narrow, where, had there been abundant
material available, they would have been broad,
for they had to carry a great deal of traffic. The<span id="Page_54" class="pagenum">[54]</span>
alternative water traffic by their side was largely
developed by the difficulty of making the road.</p>

<p>The Romans fought this difficulty with singular
tenacity. They made all their great public
constructions to last, as it were, for ever; and
they made their roads with such a strong
political and military object that they would not
be deterred save, as in the Fenlands, by the
gravest difficulties in the obtaining of material.
Thus in such of their roads as start anywhere near
a sea-beach of shingle you will find them using
that material up-country for miles, and they
will make deep foundations for roads that have
to cross clay, using, sometimes, hard stone
brought over a couple of hundreds of miles of
sea and some thirty of land travel. It is a difficulty
which has not disappeared to-day. It has
been very greatly lessened by modern means of
transport, but it still appears. We see it throughout
modern Europe: for instance, in the varying
surfaces of the different soils. The ideal
surface of broken granite is not nearly universal
even in England, as one would think modern
transport would have made it long ago, over
such a small area with such masses of granite
close at hand and accessible by sea. The relative
cost of transport still makes diversity of surface
the rule. One can make a sort of economic
barometer based on the use of granite. It
extends farther and farther from the sources of<span id="Page_55" class="pagenum">[55]</span>
supply as public wealth expands, and recedes
towards them as public wealth diminishes. We
have a first-class example of this in the case of
flint versus granite. Flint has its advantages
over all other material in hardening a roadway.
It is at once hard and easily broken: it is superficial,
and therefore cheap: it is abundant in
supply in the districts where it is used. On the
other hand, it has the gravest possible disadvantage
for modern motor traffic, which is its
effect upon the tyres indispensable to that traffic.
One could draw a graph, I think, to cover the
last ten years showing the fluctuations of this
material and granite upon the main roads of
Southern England, and the curve would follow
the opportunities of supply and of public expenditure
as affected by the Great War.</p>

<p class="chapblock"><em>The Factor of Cost Resulting in the “Strangling of Communication”:
Congestion which Leads to Decay: A
Great Modern Problem: The Compulsory Acquisition
of Land: Old Roads Serving New Objects.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">So far we have been considering the
material conditions of the Road: the
physical circumstances which determine
its trajectory. But these alone do not completely
account for its trace in practice or
theory. There is another category affecting
this, the political or moral category: the
various effects of society in modifying what,
but for them, would be the formula of least
effort. These political causes of modification
are of less effect than the physical, but they
merit a brief mention.</p>

<p>The political factors modifying the trajectory
of a road (that is, the factors due to man’s social
action and not to material causes alone) are three
in number. Firstly, the factor of cost&mdash;which is,
the economic tendency to avoid as far as possible
the destruction of old economic values in the
making of a road; secondly, legal restraints
against the Road’s following its line of least
resistance; and thirdly, the presence of a variety<span id="Page_57" class="pagenum">[57]</span>
of objects to be served, which variety again interferes
with the simple rule of finding the trajectory
of minimum effort.</p>

<p>The first of these political factors, the factor
of cost, you find even in the primitive road,
which avoids the cultivable land if it can, or
crosses it at the narrowest point available, and
you find it at the other end of the scale in our
complicated modern world, where the Road
tends to avoid the destruction of economic
values in highly concentrated town life and thus
keeps narrow when it is established, and also
fails to develop new communications. The
effect of this political restraint is constant
throughout history, great in all periods, but
increasing cumulatively with the increase of
wealth and the economic development of society.
There follows from this a most interesting historical
phenomenon, which I shall deal with at
greater length in my second section&mdash;“The
English Road”&mdash;because it would appear to be
upon the point of recurring in this island. That
phenomenon is the “strangling of communications”
in the old age of a wealthy state from
the very effect of its wealth. It is a paradox of
profound effect which you get over and over
again in the history of great mercantile cities:
their wealth&mdash;which should be their best advantage
in developing and changing communication&mdash;crystallizes
them. Their ways are<span id="Page_58" class="pagenum">[58]</span>
laid out for a particular phase of traffic. The land
on either side of the streets becomes enormously
valuable. The traffic changes in character. New
ways are demanded by the new conditions, but
they are not built because the compensation
required for disturbance terrifies the reformer.
There follows a phase during which you have
heavy congestion of traffic, and then, unless reform
comes in time, a succeeding phase of decay.</p>

<p>It is very rare in the history of great urban
centres to find the problem tackled at the right
moment and solved: to find governors of sufficient
daring to take the economic plunge. The
Government of Napoleon III did so to some
extent in the case of modern Paris (though it
left a great number of congested streets unrelieved),
and there are not a few modern
Italian towns where similar action has had its
effect: for instance, Bari. But the general rule
in history is that a city having reached its
highest point of wealth becomes congested,
refuses to accept its only remedy, and passes on
from congestion to decay.</p>

<p>How strong the influence is you may observe
in one particular historical example where its
influence is more clearly discovered than in any
other&mdash;that is, the example of the City of London
after the Great Fire of 1666.</p>

<p>Here was the finest opportunity for rebuilding
that ever a Government had. It might have<span id="Page_59" class="pagenum">[59]</span>
done what was done at Turin and laid out a new
city altogether. Two men of genius, Sir William
Temple and Sir Christopher Wren, produced
magnificent plans with broad ways, round
places for the crossings, and a carefully thought-out
scheme of transverse streets. Vested interest
and economic peril proved too strong for them.
The city was rebuilt on its old lines with narrow
lanes and alleys, courts, tortuous trace, the mark
of all which it carries to-day.</p>

<p>There is a good side to this, of course. No one
can regret the conservation of tradition. Everyone
who knew the old Paris mourned for the
antiquity which was swept away under Napoleon
III, and even in our slight changes in modern
London we are shocked at the desecration they
involve. I confess that I myself have never got
over the loss of Temple Bar, though I only
knew it as a child. If this were the main motive
at work one would criticize less strongly the
hesitation to make our town streets meet the
modern great change. But it is <em>not</em> the main
motive. The main motive is a blunder in the
science of economics. It is the idea that the
destruction of a number of imaginary economic
values (“imaginary” because they form no
part of the total real wealth of the State), to
wit, the urban site values, is in some way an
expenditure of real wealth. So far is this from
being the case that there is perhaps no example<span id="Page_60" class="pagenum">[60]</span>
in all history of a congested street-system being
reformed without the wealth of the city increasing
after the change.</p>

<p>Of the minor political questions which confront
us to-day in England this stands in the
first rank. If we do not reform our main roads
we shall handicap ourselves against our competitors,
but if we do not broaden and change
our town streets we may rapidly strangle and
atrophy our most vital centres of commerce.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>The effect of the second point, legal restraint
in modifying the line of least resistance, will be
found under two forms: the first is negative;
the lack of public powers of coercion for the acquirement
of land by which a road should pass.
The second is positive; legal restraint against
the road through ownership or privilege.</p>

<p>This political factor in the modification of
roads, the negative and positive effect of legal
restraint, works in an opposite fashion to that we
have just examined. The older, the wealthier,
the more complex a civilization the <em>less</em> this
modifying factor is present. Thus in England
for many centuries we had no compulsory power
in the hands of public authority for the making
of a new road. Such powers are, as we shall see
when we come to the story of the English Road,
a comparatively modern development. On this<span id="Page_61" class="pagenum">[61]</span>
account the Road was, until modern legislation
brought in a new system, compelled to follow
existing established ways. It could not even be
broadened, let alone a new trajectory enforced;
and the only compulsory powers in the hands
of the authorities were those permitting the
levying of labour, and later of money, for repair.</p>

<p>The same is true of the second form of legal
restraint, though in lesser degree. Privilege
(such as the deflection of an old line of road by
Act of Parliament in order, for instance, to add
to the privacy of a park&mdash;there were not a few
examples of this some generations ago) and the
positive legal restraint imposed by existing
right of ownership obviously decay <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>
with the development of public powers for
driving new roads or broadening existing ones.</p>

<p>The third political factor modifying the trajectory
of roads is that of a variety of objects
imposed upon communications by varied social
uses. As society grows more complex and at the
same time wealthier, as new centres of population
arise, new forms of travel and new needs to
be satisfied by travel, the simple formula of the
line of least effort from one point to another
suffers increasing modification. You have to
consider not only the line of least effort between
two terminals, but the due weight to be given to
intervening points which do not lie precisely
upon that line. As a rule, of course, these new
centres exercise their pressure or attraction<span id="Page_62" class="pagenum">[62]</span>
automatically, and you get a deflection arising
not from plan but from gradual necessity. The
same thing happens with new needs (as, commerce
replacing arms), but it is curious to note
how slowly the modification takes place.</p>

<p>We have a good example of this along the
south-eastern coast of England. Our ancestors
felt no attraction for living in the neighbourhood
of the sea. To use the shore as a recreation and
the sea air as a remedy is quite a modern idea.
The result is that all the old roads connected
with the sea as a terminal ran perpendicularly to
the coast, uniting a port to the inland country.
There is not a main road in England over one
hundred years old and leading from the sea
which does not start from a port. For good
communication connecting up a line of ports
laterally there was little need. The result is that
to this day, when the south coast has become
one long line of great watering-places, many of
which are fully developed modern towns on a
very large scale, there is still no complete lateral
communication. Many of the port bridges, as
I point out elsewhere in this essay, are but
recently established, many sections of the line
are served by imperfect, ill-kept pieces of road;
in one or two places it fails altogether (as round
Selsey), while in others it is built up (as at
Romney Marsh) of patchwork&mdash;old lanes running
criss-cross to each other haphazard to
make the modern line.</p>

and Chester: Towns which are Maintained by Roads:

<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">So far we have considered the origin and
development of the Road: that is, the
effect of its environment upon the Road.
We must turn, in conclusion, to the converse
aspect, which may be called “The Reaction of
the Road”&mdash;that is, the effect of the Road
upon its environment. A road once formed
immediately begins to affect in some degree the
physical circumstances surrounding it, and in
a very much greater degree the human relations
which it subserves.</p>

<p>The physical effects of the Road are few and
may be briefly mentioned. They are all connected
with the action of water, save for very
rare instances where a particular cutting has
precipitated a landslide and one or two other
exceptions of the sort. The effect of the made<span id="Page_64" class="pagenum">[64]</span>
road upon physical circumstances is, in fact,
dependent upon the conflict with precipitation
in which it is engaged.</p>

<p>It is a general rule in all man’s economic
activity that the human effort is at odds with
the general tendency of nature. Nature perpetually
tends to reassert herself, and to undo
what man has done in her despite. The Road is
no exception to this rule, and the particular way
in which it works you can see by examining
typical cases. One of these we shall come across
more particularly later on when we discuss the
Roman roads of Britain, but it may be worth
while to give its general character here.</p>

<p>The Road, finding a small stream, crosses it by
a culvert: the Road, finding a ravine with too
sharp a gradient on either side, traverses it by
an embankment; and then, even if there is no
stream at the bottom of the ravine, it leaves a
culvert or other drain for the water accumulated
after rainfall to soak through. Now, when
human effort slackens and the upkeep of a road
is no longer sufficient the culvert gets blocked
and the Road begins to act as a dam. The
lake so formed will in time destroy the obstacle,
but before this the Road will change the
countryside by the creation of such a lake succeeded
by permanent marsh. To-day the phenomenon
passes unnoticed because we are still
living in a high civilization. But it has affected<span id="Page_65" class="pagenum">[65]</span>
history strongly in the past. Whenever civilization
breaks down you begin to get a series of
marshes, with all their accompaniments of fever
and the rest growing up along the roads. The
greatest examples of the growth of marsh during
the Dark Ages were found in Italy, but there
are countless examples of the same thing all over
the north and west of the Roman Empire, and
this spreading of marsh (due also to other causes,
such as the abandonment of drains in the fens
and the breakdown of locks and sluices on river
ways) is largely caused by the special action of
the Road.</p>

<p>The same thing on a lesser scale is to be seen
where a bridge falls out of repair. The ruins
will often half-block the current and make an
overflow on either side, where, if the land is flat,
a wide belt of marsh spreads and the approaches
are ruined; so that what was a point of special
opportunity for, becomes a point of special
obstacle to, communication.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>On the political side&mdash;that is, in relation to its
human service&mdash;the reactions of the Road are
exceedingly important, and they are not always
as clearly noticed as they might be. There is a
whole group of historical social phenomena
which could be connected under the one heading
of the “attraction” of the Road, meaning<span id="Page_66" class="pagenum">[66]</span>
by the word “attraction” the way in which the
Road compels communication to follow it once
it is established. This attraction produces a
quantity of effects countering or crossing
general economic tendencies, and it acts in
countless ways.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of this is the draining
of population down on to the Road. When a
map is drawn up showing the density of population
we see upon it separate areas of density,
sometimes far apart, and between them areas
marked by lesser density or even void. But if
one should make an accurate population map of
any one moment, plotting down every individual
upon it, you would not get this effect of
isolated dense districts; you would not get the
effect of an archipelago, but of a network; for
upon the communications between these districts
would be marked a dense chain of units
in progress from the one to the other: and
one would at once grasp how permanent lesser
nuclei arise between the two terminal towns.
This aspect of the Road suggests a far more important
one. The Road&mdash;in the sense of a means
of communication&mdash;in proportion to its excellence
differentiates human society</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<em>a</em>) Into areas of density and void;</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<em>b</em>) Into the urban political habit and the
agricultural political habit.</p>

<p>This is a very important reaction of the Road,<span id="Page_67" class="pagenum">[67]</span>
which must be allowed for in every historical
and contemporary problem.</p>

<p>Granted an urban centre, with its special
opportunities for inter-communication between
human beings, for experiment and for what
may be called “the cross-fertilization of knowledge,”
the growth of such a centre is, of course,
dependent upon many things: its economic
basis, either as a market or as the capital of a
productive area, or, more commonly, as both;
the physical surroundings which may, as in the
case of Genoa or Venice for instance, strictly
limit that growth, etc. But among the causes
affecting it, and chief among them, is the Road:
the degree of excellence in communication.</p>

<p>The growth of a town is a direct function of
this, the most conspicuous example, of course,
in the whole of history being the immense
growth of London following on the supplementing
of the old roads by the railway.</p>

<p>In direct connection with this you have a
mass of subsidiary effects, all of the highest importance
to the State. The Road having caused
the growth of the city, after a certain point a
high differentiation arises between urban and
rural life. The differentiation may become so
great that you arrive at a clash of fundamental
interests in which one of the two is defeated.
You certainly have had that in modern England
during the last two generations. The towns<span id="Page_68" class="pagenum">[68]</span>
became so much the more important part of
English life that the agricultural life was entirely
sacrificed to them&mdash;and the Road was the
ultimate cause. Again, you get the curious
development of what may be called “reserve”
towns: towns like Brighton and Blackpool,
which are the playgrounds of the greater cities
at a distance; the large urban centre breeds,
as it were, a lesser one after its own pattern.
You have got in modern times that further
curious reaction due to growing excellence of
communications&mdash;that is, due to the growth of
the Road&mdash;the <em>pulse</em> of the great modern city.
Crowds of human beings pour out of Victoria
or Liverpool Street into London and pour
back from London in the evening. The station
of St. Lazare in Paris is, in Europe, the most
striking visual evidence of this strange modern
development, great floods of human beings
cascading into the city at the opening day and
ebbing back at its close.</p>

<p>At bottom, like so many other human arrangements,
this “pulse” is a negation of its own
principles&mdash;a sub-conscious effect which a fully
thought-out plan could have avoided. There is
no true economic basis for it, or, at any rate,
not for the most of it.</p>

<p>There will always be advantages, of course, in
the central point, and always some tendency in
men to seek that central point in order to enjoy<span id="Page_69" class="pagenum">[69]</span>
those advantages. Ten men may desire to seek
daily the central point which has only habitation-room
for one, and that will lead to the
“pulse” of which I speak. But the necessity
for seeking it daily is already very largely an
artificial necessity and is becoming more and
more artificial every day. The same work can
be done perfectly well at a distance as is now
done in centres, and in a roundabout way that
truth is impressing itself through an economic
effect. The rents become so high in the crowded
centre that whole groups of activities which do
not really need a central position tend to disperse
themselves to the outer boundaries. The
printing trade, in those branches which are not
hurried (the printing of books, for instance), is
a good example of this.</p>

<p>When men debate the probable future of our
great cities they often omit one very likely
development, which is the creation of a number
of suburban centres which, if the material side
of our civilization declines, will become independent
towns and the probable decay of the
central nucleus out of which they all grow. It
is a speculation worth examining.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>The reaction of the Road upon society, its
political reaction, has many other departments.
For instance, in the communication of ideas the<span id="Page_70" class="pagenum">[70]</span>
trace of a road will give you the advance of some
religious development otherwise inexplicable.
I have pointed out through more than one historical
allusion in other work how the spread
of the Christian religion may be directly followed
along the trace of the chief Roman roads,
and especially of the great trunk road of the
Empire running from Egypt to the Wall in
Northumberland. You have only to make a
list of names standing on that trunk road to
show that it corresponds to a list of dates and
names in the story of the conversion of Europe&mdash;Alexandria,
Jerusalem, Damascus, Antioch,
Tarsus, Ephesus, Athens, Brindisi, Naples,
Rome, Lyons, Autun, Canterbury, London, St.
Albans.</p>

<p>Again, a road which for some reason has
become established along an artificial line, a line
not directly dictated by the formula of minimum
effort, will “canalize” traffic, so that, even when
an alternative and better way has been provided,
institutions and towns and all that goes for
human activity will have taken root along the
old way and all history will be deflected by the
deflection of the Road.</p>

<p>We have a very interesting example of this
here in England in the case of the great road to
the north-west. In the earliest times Chester
was the one terminal and London the other.
Chester was the port for Ireland, and, because<span id="Page_71" class="pagenum">[71]</span>
it was much easier going along the coast than
over the mountains, Chester was also the base
point of departure for the penetration of North
Wales. Chester was also the great garrison
whence troops could be detached for the Lancashire
plain and for the western end of the
Wall. Nevertheless, Chester, though it maintained
for centuries its inevitable importance,
had a rival in the Roman town of Uriconium,
under the Wrekin: one of the very few Roman
towns which have disappeared&mdash;though it has
its modern counterpart in Shrewsbury. The
campaigns against the Welsh were based for
hundreds of years as much on this middle section
of Shrewsbury as on the northern one of
Chester. Finally, when modern engineering
made possible a direct trajectory through the
mountains, this middle Shrewsbury section
fixed the Holyhead road, which would otherwise
have gone round by Chester. The main railway
system to the north-west, as we know, has been
compelled to follow the coast, and but for the
deflection of the ancient road round by Shrewsbury
that road would have done exactly what
the modern railway does.</p>

<p>Now, why was there this strange bend westward
and southward towards Shrewsbury in the
road making ultimately for Chester? It was
because, when the Roman Empire was at the
height of its material power, when things were<span id="Page_72" class="pagenum">[72]</span>
working best and public works were most energetically
created and maintained, <em>the Romans
had not fully conquered the North</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore their chief trouble with the Welsh
mountaineers during that earlier moment was
with those of the Central mountains rather than
of the North. They had, it is true, established
their garrison in Chester. But in making their
first great trunk road they had been compelled
to choose a more southern terminal, hence what
is still called the Watling Street curls round by
Penkridge (a Roman name descended from
the Roman place-name of the Itinerary) and
then makes westward. Later, when the conquest
was more complete, a branch was thrown
out from Shrewsbury northward to Chester.
Long after a short cut was driven from Penkridge
to Chester direct. We have grounds for belief
that this last road was of later and inferior work,
because, though the traces of it survive, the
main work has almost wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that the original trackway
before the Romans came would have run pretty
directly from London to Chester without going
round by the Shrewsbury district; and, indeed,
the course to which all the first part of the Watling
Street points is evidence of that. When the
Roman military engineers began their thorough
rebuilding of the roads (in the most permanent
fashion in the world) they were at first confined<span id="Page_73" class="pagenum">[73]</span>
to the southern plain, in which alone
they felt secure, and hence was that deflection
round westward towards Shrewsbury created
which has affected the whole of English history.</p>

<p>You may next observe the Road producing
the economic effect of maintaining towns, and
especially ports. A road being driven from an
existing port to some inland terminus and the
port later becoming less and less useful, either
through the building of ships too deep for it or
silting up or what not, the mere existence of the
Road tends to make men cling to the port in
spite of its disadvantages. They will, as a rule,
from the effect of custom and of vested interest,
from the attraction of the points already established
on the Road, expend in the maintenance
of the port more energy than would have been
required to build an alternative road to some
new and better port. The effect of this is very
marked in Northern France. Boulogne was not
only the great Roman port of the channel
because it stood in the Narrows; it was also of
such importance because it was in antiquity a
very broad, secure, land-locked estuary, stretching
over what is now all dry land up above the
town three miles towards Pont-de-Briques.
Centuries ago the harbour silted up, and if it had
been left alone it would be hardly serviceable at
all. But every effort has been made to maintain
that point. Boulogne harbour has been steadily<span id="Page_74" class="pagenum">[74]</span>
maintained artificially for centuries because the
road led to it and needed it, and the alternative
use of the far superior estuary of the Seine, with
the corresponding growth of Havre, only came
quite late in history.</p>

<p>The Road has the same canalizing effect
where it overcomes an obstacle such as a broad
river, or a mountain chain, or a belt of dense
woodland. For instance, the fertile lowland
fringe of South Wales and the corresponding
fertile land to the east of the Severn were connected,
when primitive methods alone could be
used, by the bridge at Gloucester, high up the
river. The lower reaches were too much for the
earlier engineers, especially in the face of such
a tide as runs on them. As a result the whole of
that line of communications remained for 2000
years highly deflected, and only quite recently
has there been some attempt at the more natural
line by the piercing of the Severn tunnel.</p>

<p>This effect of the Road in canalizing human
effort is specially marked in the case of armies.
The saying “an army is tied to the road” is a
truth which historians should always keep in
mind. There have been great cavalry raids in
history&mdash;not often of permanent effect&mdash;which
marched on a broad front, almost free of roads,
and dependent only upon a sufficiency of forage.
They have come from the grazing grounds of
Asia, as a rule, and swept over the plains of<span id="Page_75" class="pagenum">[75]</span>
Eastern Europe; but the organized and disciplined
forces which have moulded history
have always of necessity followed the Road. An
army is not an island. It is an organism connected
by a stalk with its base and dependent on
this stalk for its feeding and equipment, its passing
back of its prisoners and its wounded, and
all its life. All these depend upon the Road.
There are even cases in history&mdash;more numerous
than one might imagine&mdash;where the first creation
of the Road has been due to military action
<em>alone</em>. I believe that the United States show
examples of this, especially along the border
between the northern and southern states east
of the Mississippi. Certainly Europe shows
them in striking fashion: it was a military
necessity which made the great roads linking
up the stations on the Rhine with the towns of
Gaul and the rest of the Empire; it was a
military necessity which made the regular roads
over the Alpine passes. You can hardly say that
there was a <em>commercial</em> necessity for the great
trunk road which struck the Rhine at Cologne,
and which there later created the first bridge
across the river. The country beyond was barbarous,
and though a large number of Roman
merchants penetrated it and a corresponding
amount of trade was done, the main necessity for
Cologne was a military necessity. Military necessity
which drove the great road from the heart of<span id="Page_76" class="pagenum">[76]</span>
Northern France to this isolated point and so
opened up the wild wooded region in between.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>The negative effect of the Road, the effect of
its breakdown, especially at the bridges and in
the causeways over marshy land, is equally indisputable
in human relations. We have the
typical case of Sussex remaining heathen for
one hundred years after the conversion of its
neighbours, because the main road from the
north with its causeway everywhere crossing
the clay and piercing the scrub of the weald
fell into decay, and because the bridge at
Alfoldean broke down. It is most significant
that the great battle of Ockley was fought north
of this break in communications. The Danes,
marching from London against the English
army, could get down as far south as this, and
the English army coming up from Hampshire
could intercept them as far south as this, but all
the Danish attack on Sussex, such as it was (and
it was very slight), came from the sea.</p>

<p>Another very conspicuous example of the
breakdown of the Road and of the political
effect thereof is the chaos you get in the Balkan
peninsula after the decay of the great Roman
trunk roads. If the Greek Church is to-day
separate from the Latin Church to the west it
is due not only to the obstacle of the Pinsk<span id="Page_77" class="pagenum">[77]</span>
Marshes in the north, but to the gradual decline
in the south of the main artery between Durazzo
and Constantinople. For centuries old and new
Rome communicated by the great trunk road
down to Brundusium and then across the narrow
sea to Dyracchium and Byzantium. When
that traffic began to be interrupted the contrast
between the east and the west was founded and
increased.</p>

<p>A last minor effect of the Road upon human
society is the use of the Road as a <em>boundary</em>.
That is a use, of course, which hardly ever
develops in a high civilization. On the contrary,
a road of its nature should run <em>transverse</em>
to boundaries. It is built to unite towns the
territories of which have boundaries naturally
perpendicular to the Road. The road from
Canterbury to London, for instance (the first
great main road in this island), is transverse to
the Darent frontier, and all the great roads
from the French-speaking to the German-speaking
country on this side of the Rhine are
transverse to the language boundary. It is in
the very function of a road to be thus transverse
to political limits. But with the decay of civilization
the remains of a great, well-built road
lend themselves at once to the idea of a boundary.
Men need something to which they can
perpetually refer which will be a permanent
mark and which will be indisputable. A river<span id="Page_78" class="pagenum">[78]</span>
is thus often so chosen; sometimes, but much
more rarely, a range of hills, especially where
the crest is particularly steep and marked. But
the Road, when the use of documents declines
and when record is with difficulty maintained&mdash;the
Road, especially if it has been built to endure,
comes in to fulfil this artificial function. Here
in England we have more examples of this than
in any other part of Europe. Very often you
can recover a Roman road first by noting on the
map the parish boundaries running on straight
lines, which are the prolongation one of the
other, and the survival of a Roman road used
in the Dark Ages to define a parochial limit.
The Road is thus also used as a boundary not
only for parishes but for states, not only for
states but for realms. The Roman road to the
north-west of London was part of the great
boundary established between Wessex and the
Danish territories of the north and east. One
could quote hundreds of cases with a little
research, but best of all perhaps is that of the
boundary of Westminster, which dates from the
heart of the Dark Ages. The northern limit
of the manor was fixed by the great Roman
military road which to this day survives and is
the boundary of Hyde Park on the north.</p>

<p class="chapblock"><em>Through the Dim Ages: The Characteristics of the
English Road: Absence of Plan: A Local instead of a
National System Leading to the Present Crisis.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The general theory of the Road having
been discussed, we may next turn to the
particular case of <span class="smcap">The English Road</span>,
my second and concluding section. The English
Road has, as we shall see, highly-marked
characteristics of its own which are of immediate
concern to us at this revolutionary moment in
the economic history of the State.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the English Road followed,
of course, the story of all the other
main English institutions in their outline.
Just as you had the pre-Roman barbaric
period, then the Roman period, then the Dark
Ages in the general history of the State, so you
had the British trackway, the Roman Road, and
the continued use during the continued decline
of the latter as material civilization fell away
after the fifth century. The spring of the Middle
Ages gave you the renaissance of the Road.
The Black Death, which is the watershed of the
Middle Ages, breaks the history of the Road
just as it breaks the history of the language.<span id="Page_82" class="pagenum">[82]</span>
French dies out: all England is speaking
English in the generation after the Black Death,
and there is a great change throughout society.
That change is marked on the roads by a considerable
decline in travel, coupled with the use
of better means of transport&mdash;a paradox to
which our times are not accustomed. But you
get a good deal of that in the Middle Ages.
You have, for instance, a decline of wealth in
the monasteries, and yet more detailed building
in the monasteries; a bad decline in manuscript
writing, both with regard to accuracy and
legibility, and yet an increase in the amount
written. So far as we can judge from our very
imperfect evidence, after the Black Death (the
middle of the fourteenth century) the volume of
traffic upon the roads of England tends to get
less, and perhaps the surface also deteriorates,
though that is more doubtful.</p>

<p>The Reformation, and especially the dissolution
of the monasteries, is the next great date.
The violent revolution imposed <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1536-40
on every department of the national life affects
the roads as it affects all else. In general, the
Reformation, especially through the dissolution
of the monasteries, had the following
economic effects upon England:</p>

<p class="hangindent">(1) Customary economic action tended to be
replaced, after the change, by competitive
economic action;<span id="Page_83" class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p class="hangindent">(2) Corporate action tended to be replaced by
individual action;</p>

<p class="hangindent">(3) The principal land-owning class&mdash;the
squires&mdash;became much wealthier than
they had been in proportion to the rest
of the community.</p>

<p>The accommodation of these three main
economic facts had the general result of substituting
more and more statutory duties in
local affairs for customary duties, and it affected
the roads thus: where the local community had,
in a customary fashion, kept up the local road
as part of the old social habit the new lay owner
refused. He was averse to the outlay, the Crown
had less control over him, and as he was running
the whole thing on an idea of profit and loss
every outlay was cut by him as much as possible.</p>

<p>There was at the same time a revolution in
agriculture, a falling off of population, the
throwing together of small holdings, the
growth of grazing, and the decline of tillage.</p>

<p>You consequently get, through the common
action of all these influences combined, in
the middle of the Reformation period the first
interference of the central Government by
direct statute in the making and conservation of
the English road system. This famous piece of
legislation (2 and 3 Philip and Mary, Cap.
VIII) is familiar to all who deal with the law and
history of the highway. It governed the constitution<span id="Page_84" class="pagenum">[84]</span>
and maintenance of English roads
right down to the great modern change in the
same which falls under the general term
“turnpike.” These are the main stages in the
story of the Road in this island up to the present
moment, when, apparently, another stage has
opened.</p>

<p>We have for these seven chapters very
different information: on the first nothing but
conjecture, on the second a considerable body of
evidence, on the third again conjecture, and on
the fourth conjecture, though conjecture filled
in from the indirect evidence of historical event.
For the second mediaeval period we have even
less evidence than for the first. Our knowledge
begins to grow after the increase of wheeled
traffic, and with the early eighteenth century
becomes for the first time full and detailed.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>We will now follow this development.</p>

<p><a href="#Part_II_Sketch_I">The English Road has a character of its own
which clearly differentiates it from the other
road systems of Western Europe</a>. So sharp is the
distinction that, since modern travel recovered
the use of the road through petrol traffic, the
new type of road he discovers is, after the
language, the most striking novelty affecting
the foreigner on his arrival.</p>

<p>Abroad, the French model&mdash;recovered from<span id="Page_86" class="pagenum">[86]</span>
the Roman tradition, remodelled in the late
seventeenth century, and vastly developed in the
nineteenth&mdash;has impressed itself everywhere:
the Road is there built up on a framework of
very broad, straight main ways, carefully graded,
proceeding everywhere upon one plan. These
are connected by a subsidiary net of country
ways less direct and less broad, but all carefully
planned and graded, and these in turn by local
lanes of all surfaces and gradients and gauges,
dependent upon parish rates and betraying by
their irregularity their independence of the
national system.</p>

<div id="Ref_87" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Typical English Lane</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Here the scheme is contradicted at every
point. A long stretch dead straight is very rare:
when it is found it is due to some accident of
local choice. The surface differs not as between
the main road and local road, but indiscriminately:
a small parish way will often have
a better surface than the main road it joins.
The gauge is haphazard: the main road
between the capital and some great port will go
through the most surprising changes in breadth,
here appearing as the narrow high street of a
suburb, and there, a few miles on, spreading to
50 feet upon an open heath, then again turning
abruptly round the sharp right-angle corners
and between the irregular frontages of a village.
The English roads are far more numerous, the
mileage of good road surface to the hundred<span id="Page_89" class="pagenum">[89]</span>
square miles far greater, than abroad. Yet not
one of them is planned throughout. They all
twist, the lesser ones winding perpetually and
usually without any reason of their own, compelled
to such anomalies by the custom of older
paths, by enclosures, by encroachments. For
the most part these roads, from the most important
to the least, are “blind,” that is,
bounded by obstacles which mask the approach
of corners and conceal the country on either
side: a very pronounced national characteristic,
due mainly to the use of hedges upon the
more fertile land. The grading is never continuous&mdash;the
main roads in which this feature
has been most thoroughly looked to yet have
astonishing exceptions of 1 in 9, 1 in 8. The
bridges are of varying strength, half of them
bearing warnings that they are dangerous to
heavy vehicles.</p>

<p>When we seek the origin of this strange mixture
of serviceable and unserviceable in the English
road system we discover it in the political history
of the country. The English hedged roads yield
their more pleasing landscape, they have more
length to the square mile than those abroad,
they are haphazard in gauge and gradient (only
half planned), they have such excellent surface
(and that independently of their importance),
such a strange assortment of bridges, such
abrupt and blind corners&mdash;all because the Road,<span id="Page_90" class="pagenum">[90]</span>
like every other institution, is a function of
society, and because English society proceeded
on special political lines of its own after the
Reformation.</p>

<p>Like the road systems of every other country,
that of England arose from the great Roman
military ways. It went through exactly the
same phases of decline as those of the neighbouring
Continent, it had the same new development
in the Middle Ages, it ran through open
fields mainly. A man put down on an English
road of Henry VIII or Elizabeth’s day would
have marked no great distinction between its
character and those of a Flanders or a Breton or
a Provençal road, or the roads of the Rhine.</p>

<p>But with the seventeenth century the profound
change which had worked for a hundred years
throughout all English life appeared in the Road.
The monarchy fell. A national road system became
impossible. The local landlords took command
of society. The <em>local</em> road was the only basis
for development. Commons were enclosed, co-operative
village farming gradually disappeared,
the hedges everywhere increased in number,
cutting up the old open fields. Any extension
of communication could only come through the
linking up of tortuous village ways.</p>

<p>Then came the industrial revolution, the exploitation
of better surface through the turnpike,
the epoch of Telford and Macadam.<span id="Page_91" class="pagenum">[91]</span>
Lastly, the huge increase of the great towns in the
middle and later nineteenth century, the coming
of the internal combustion engine, and the
present crisis. For we have come to a crisis
to-day in the history of the English Road.
It must be changed&mdash;or supplemented&mdash;under
peril of such congestion as will strangle travel
and interchange: that is the interest of the
subject to-day.</p>

<p>I propose, therefore, in what follows to consider,
first, how this particular character in the
English Road developed: what were the agencies
which gradually made it so different from the
road of the neighbouring Continent: next, to
sketch very briefly and only in its bare outline
the history of the English Road, and to conclude
with an examination of the reforms which we
should undertake and the crisis in travel and
the use of the Road which has led to that
duty.</p>

</div>

<p class="chapblock"><em>The Two Causes Governing the Development of English
Roads&mdash;Waterways and Domestic Peace: The Relation
of the English Road to Military Strategy.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Of many of the features of the English
Road we can determine the origins at
once, for they are of common knowledge.
The “blindness” of the English Road is
due to the enclosures and the consequent
increase in hedges since the seventeenth century,
coupled, as I have said, with the dying
out of “champion” or “co-operative” open-field
farming. It is in part due, also, to that
which has also been alluded to and has affected
the English Road in all its aspects (surface,
variation of gauge and gradient, tortuousness,
etc.), the government of the squires following
on the defeat of the monarchy nearly three
hundred years ago. I shall touch on this
again when I come to the history of the
English Road.</p>

<p>But, apart from these obvious and well-known
causes, two causes much less familiar&mdash;and yet
of the first importance&mdash;two causes peculiar to<span id="Page_93" class="pagenum">[93]</span>
this island in all Europe, have governed its
development: waterways and domestic peace.</p>

<p>The English road system has been so powerfully
affected by these two agencies&mdash;the one
physical, the other political&mdash;as to have become
wholly differentiated by them from the systems
of the Western Continent. The natural feature
then is <em>the omnipresence of waterways</em> throughout
the island; and the political feature is domestic
peace&mdash;that is <em>the absence since the modern development
of roads began (during the last 250 years)
of strategical necessities on a large scale</em>.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>I will take these two things in their order.</p>

<p>The way in which the whole history of
England has been modified by the presence of
water is a topographical point of capital importance
to the understanding of the national
life. There is no other large island in the world
which has rivers in anything like the same proportion
as we have, either in number or in disposition.
Most of the large islands have no
navigable rivers at all. Sicily has none, Iceland
has none, nor Crete, nor Cyprus, nor Sardinia,
nor Corsica. Not only have we a host of navigable
rivers, but they are so disposed that they
penetrate the very heart of the country. The
Trent, for instance, is the most arresting thing
upon the map. It looks almost as though it had<span id="Page_94" class="pagenum">[94]</span>
been specially designed to make the inmost heart
of England penetrable to commerce and travel
in the east. The Thames, in the same way, goes
right into the heart of southern central England;
and even the Severn, the rapidity of which has
militated against its modern use, had a considerable
use in the past and was an artery in
the Middle Ages, even for upward traffic, to
the neighbourhood of Wenlock Edge.</p>

<p>The great rivers alone, however, do not
account for the most of this character. It is the
mass of small but navigable streams, both
tributary to the main systems and isolated along
the coast, which have so profoundly affected our
history. If you take one of those outline maps
of England with the waterways only marked,
such as are sold for use in schools, and plot out
the highest point upon a stream to which a
fairly loaded boat can penetrate, you will be
astonished to find how small a central area
is left out. One might say that the whole of
England, outside the hill country of the Pennines,
the Lakes, and the border, is so penetrated
by water carriage that if there were no
roads at all its life could, under primitive conditions,
be carried on by waterways alone.</p>

<p>Now this universal presence of waterways,
which meant every opportunity for internal
traffic and also for approach from outside the
island, has had two effects upon the Road.<span id="Page_95" class="pagenum">[95]</span>
First, it has made for <em>diversion</em>&mdash;that is, for the
modification of the English Road from a direct
to an indirect and sinuous line. Secondly, it
has <em>interrupted</em> what would otherwise be main
lines of travel in the necessity under which men
found themselves of turning aside for the lowest
bridge upon each stream.</p>

<p>As to the first of these points, it will at once be
observed that unless you have some strong compelling
motive for driving a simple straight line
you will, in a country of many rivers, avoid such
a scheme and seek for the cheapest crossing of
each water. You must seek a ford, or narrow,
or a place with specially hard banks, and not
merely take haphazard that part of the stream
which lies on your direct line, and seeing that
such numerous waterways involve also long
numerous flats along the streams, valley floors
subject to flood or formed of boggy soil, the
tendency to diversion in a road system under
such conditions is intensified by the marshes
which abound in a country so watered.</p>

<p>If you look at the Roman road system you
will see how, for the considerations which I will
deal with later, it usually; if not always, neglects
special opportunities and takes the water as it
comes, preferring an expensive straight line to
a cheaper winding line; but everything done
since the Roman road system has been affected
by the perpetual consideration of the easiest<span id="Page_96" class="pagenum">[96]</span>
river crossings inland, while the same influence
has deflected the road round the greater
estuaries and ports.</p>

</div>

<p>The lowest bridge over a river is a point of
transformation. It stops traffic from the sea
going any higher. But to carry on your journey<span id="Page_97" class="pagenum">[97]</span>
from the sea as far as possible is obviously an
economic advantage, especially in early days
of expensive and slow road traffic. Therefore a
nation dealing with the sea and largely living
through sea-trade casts its first bridge <em>as far up
stream as possible</em>, and that is exactly what you
find upon all the rivers of England for centuries.
Even to this day the tendency to build
bridges lower down than the old first bridge is
checked, in spite of the very strong motive we
have in the development of the railway system.
Take a map <a href="#Part_II_Sketch_II">(Sketch II</a>), and look round the
coast and see how true this is.</p>

<p>The lowest old bridge of the Tyne was at
Newcastle; of the Trent, I believe, at Gainsborough;
of the Thames, of course, right up
inland at London; of the Stour, at Canterbury;
of the Sussex Ouse, at Lewes; of the Arun, at
Arundel; of the Exe, at Exeter. The deep
arms of Plymouth Sound were unbridged until
the railway came; so Fowey river and the Fal,
unbridged to this day; the Severn is not
bridged at all till Gloucester, nor was the Dee
till Chester.</p>

<p>Now this had the effect everywhere of checking
a direct road system and deflecting the
ways everywhere to suit the convenience of the
ports. And there again we find, for reasons
which will be given in a moment, the Roman
roads directly crossing estuaries, but every subsequent<span id="Page_98" class="pagenum">[98]</span>
road system going round them. Take
two examples. The Roman road to the north,
which runs all along the ridge of Lincolnshire,
strikes the Humber where that stream is
from 2000 to 3000 yards wide, crosses by a
ferry, and continues on the far side.</p>

<p>The Roman road system of Kent did the
same thing over the Wansum when that stream
was&mdash;as Rice Holmes has proved&mdash;a broad
estuary 3000 yards across, with Richborough
as an island in its midst. The Roman road from
Dover and the one from Canterbury met at
a point opposite Richborough, whence a ferry
took people across to Richborough.</p>

<p>Again, the Roman road to the lead mines of
the Mendips ends at the wide mouth of the
Severn, and is carried on again on the far Welsh
side. But every road system since has gone
right round by Gloucester, and the inconvenient
effects of this, as road travel develops
and water carriage declines, are very noticeable
to-day. In all that southern coast of Devon
between Lyme Regis and the Exe, if you want
to get round to the maritime south-western
bulge of the county you must make an elbow
through Exeter. Similarly the Sussex coast, now
so crowded, has only been linked up quite recently
by bridges: the one at Shoreham was built
within living memory, the swing bridge at
Littlehampton is an affair of the last few<span id="Page_99" class="pagenum">[99]</span>
years, as also the swing bridge at Newhaven
of this generation. For 1500 years no one
could proceed along that coast continuously
from, say, Portsmouth by Littlehampton, Shoreham,
Seaford (later Newhaven), Hastings, Rye,
without turning inland to cross at Arundel, at
Bramber, at Lewes, at Robertsbridge. One of
the subsidiary effects of this interruption was
the comparative ease with which the coast could
be attacked from the sea, for the difficulty of
rapid concentration upon any one point, in the
lack of lateral communication, handicapped the
defending force by land. All through mediaeval
history the Sussex coast was raided from the sea.
So much for the effect of waterways, the main
physical cause of diversion in the English Road.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>The political cause of diversion has been, as
I say, the negative effect of an absence of grand
strategy in modern times. There has been no
grand strategy in this country since the Romans,
because there has been no fighting of a highly-organized
type within the island during the
whole of its post-Roman history. There was a
great deal of barbaric fighting in the Dark
Ages, and a great deal of feudal fighting in the
Middle Ages. Even in the beginning of modern
organized warfare you had (on a very small
scale, it is true) the civil wars.</p>

<p><span id="Page_100" class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>But since then&mdash;that is, during the whole of
the period in which modern road systems have
developed (1660 onwards)&mdash;there has been no
necessity for strategical considerations to affect
the English road system at all, and, therefore,
no political force strong enough to compel direct
roads was present in opposition to the strong
economic motive for diversion.</p>

<p>The result is an anomaly that might well
become serious if we had to depend upon our
road system under the threat of invasion. Look,
for instance, at the two great handicaps, the
Humber and the Thames. A force standing up
to meet a threatened landing which might be
directed against Kent or against East Anglia
would be divided into two sections, deprived of
road communication save round through London.
During the War a temporary bridge was
thrown across the Thames (in the neighbourhood
of Tilbury, if I remember aright), but,
of course, with a gate for traffic. In normal
times you could not have such a thing. The
water traffic is too great and too confused. But
what you could have would be a tunnel, and
though the necessity for it may never arise it is
also true that should it arise we shall bitterly
regret not having driven that tunnel. The same
remark applies with even greater force to the
Humber. An attempted landing on the north-east
coast of England, threatening alternatively<span id="Page_101" class="pagenum">[101]</span>
the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire coasts, would
find the defending force cut in two, and were
the strategics of this position to become acute
we should regret the lack of a road tunnel under
the Humber, just as we should regret the lack
of a road tunnel under the Thames.</p>

<p>The third principal case, that of the Severn, is
partially met by a railway tunnel&mdash;the Severn
Tunnel, far below Gloucester. A road tunnel
would hardly suggest itself here. There is not
a sufficient “potential” for it on either side of
the stream. But here again it might well happen
that under the particular circumstances of war
we should regret the absence of it.</p>

<p>This negative factor, the absence of a strategic
“driving motive,” has also left the windings of
the internal road system at the mercy of the
easiest crossings of the rivers, and we see how
different the thing would have been under a
strategic scheme. Consider the Roman contrast.
The Roman roads of Britain were principally
military. The whole scheme of Roman
government was military, and the life of all
that civilization was founded on the army.
With the marching of men rapidly and easily
from place to place as the main motive of the
builders, the roads follow those great straight
lines which, while duly seeking a formula of
minimum effort, never sacrificed to it directness
of plan. As we have seen, even at the great<span id="Page_102" class="pagenum">[102]</span>
estuaries Roman engineers preferred a supplementary
ferry to continue the road rather than
deflecting it round by the first bridge.</p>

<p>In this connection, however&mdash;that of estuaries&mdash;there
is one case which is puzzling: the
case of the Thames. An explanation can,
I think, be found, though at first it looks
anomalous. The Romans dealt with the estuary
of the Severn and of the Humber by ferries;
they dealt by long bridges with lesser obstacles.
In the same fashion they carried the north road
over the Trent by a direct line without deflection
for a special crossing. They carried it
across the Tyne at deep water approached
steeply. They carried it across the Thames at
Staines with a sole regard to the direction of
their road and without considering special
opportunities of crossing. They did the same at
Dorchester; and instances could be multiplied
all over the kingdom. But apparently they did
not attempt to attack the Thames estuary.</p>

<p>When one considers the nature of the early
fighting during the first conquest of the island
by the Romans this is astonishing. All the campaigns
began in Kent, and the more serious of
them were carried on into East Anglia. The great
rising under Nero was an East Anglian rising,
and the Roman armies beaten there had to be
rapidly reinforced from Kent. For 400 years
troops poured in, under any special emergency,<span id="Page_103" class="pagenum">[103]</span>
from Dover, came up through Kent, and any
immediate necessity of reaching a point east of
London necessitated a détour by London
Bridge: though time might be vital, the deflection
was suffered.</p>

<p>Why did the Romans not solve the difficulty
and establish at least a ferry across the lower
Thames? Of course, they may have done so.
You can never argue from the absence of traces
to-day that a Roman road did not exist, for it
is astonishing how thoroughly time eliminates
such things. There are whole great towns like
Aquilea and Hippo of which not even the
foundations remain to-day. Even in England,
where Roman survival is most marked, two
towns, Silchester and Uriconium, have gone
save for a few ruins; and there are great stretches
of Roman road in every country of Western
Europe which have mysteriously and wholly
disappeared without leaving a trace of the tremendous
work undertaken to build them; for
instance, the miles after Epsom racecourse.
Still, it does look as though no direct Roman
line connected Canterbury, for instance, with
Colchester. And I say again, how are we to
account for it?</p>

<p>I think the explanation lies in the disposition
of the marsh lands on the lower Thames. If
you take the map of the Thames below the
Isle of Dogs and mark upon it all that must<span id="Page_104" class="pagenum">[104]</span>
have been primeval marsh (including much that
is still marsh) you will see that wherever hard
land is found upon one bank it is faced by
extensive swamp upon the other. There was no
good position for a permanent crossing even
by ferry, and in the whole military history of
England we only know one doubtful case in
which a junction was effected from south to
north, which is in the pursuit of the defeated
British army by the Romans in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 43 under
Aulus Plautius. If, as is probable (though not
certain), that battle took place at Rochester,
then the pursuit was carried on by a direct
crossing of the lower Thames; but with that
exception I can call to mind no military action
in the whole of our history where the lower
Thames did not prove a permanent obstacle.</p>

<p>It is an amusing speculation to think what
would have happened to the road system of
England if strategic necessity had appeared
again during the modern period. The thing is
purely hypothetical, but I might make a few
suggestions.</p>

<p>In the first place, we should certainly have had
a road linking up the southern coast; next, we
should certainly have had some form of continuous
traffic over the lower Severn and the
lower Thames and the Humber; next, without
doubt, there would have been pierced a broad,
continuous, and fairly direct road from the plain<span id="Page_105" class="pagenum">[105]</span>
of Yorkshire to the plain of Lancashire across
the Pennines; next, we should have had, of
course, a broadening of all the ways leading to
the main ports. That would have been essential,
and particularly to the ports of the Straits
of Dover. But, as I have said, the whole thing
is a dream, because not that strategic motive,
but now a purely economic motive is compelling
us to revise our system.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>Apart from these two main causes of waterways,
and of the absence of strategic necessity
causing the diversion of the English Road, and
apart from all other causes of local government
which have led to such extraordinary diversity,
lack of regular gradient, lack of regular gauge,
etc. (as distinguished from the road system under
the monarchical and centralized governments
of the Continent, and especially of France), we
have certain other elements which have stamped
the English Road with its particular character.</p>

<p>They may be briefly recapitulated without
developing any one of them. We shall meet
most of them again in the historical sketch of
the English Road.</p>

<p>There is the dampness of the climate; there
is the extraordinary diversity of soil within a
comparatively small area, so that road-making
material continually differs within a few miles&mdash;for<span id="Page_106" class="pagenum">[106]</span>
England is, of all European countries, that
in which there is crowded upon a small space
the greatest, sharpest, and most frequent diversity
of soil and landscape; there is the increasing
density of population in modern times, which
has had a profound effect upon our road
system. There is the political factor of Parliament;
for since the defeat of the monarchy in
the seventeenth century no direct order could
be immediately obeyed until there quite recently
grew up the new powers of administration.
Between, say, 1660 and the Premiership
of the late Lord Salisbury we may say that any
important public right, including the making of
a new way and expropriation of land for it,
fell under no immediate authority but had to be
referred to the lengthy and expensive process
of a Committee, called Parliamentary, through
which the oligarchy of Great Britain worked.</p>

<p>All these things have affected the development
of the English Road, but most of all, let
it always be remembered, these two main
causes, which have been, in my opinion, far too
little recognized&mdash;the waterways, peculiar to
this island, and the absence of modern strategic
necessity, also peculiar to this island.</p>

<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Let us next turn to a very rough sketch of
the development of the history of the
English Road: the stages through which
its development has passed, measured, not from
cause to effect, but in time.</p>

<p>Before turning to this I would first define
the use of a certain word already used which
will recur and may be unfamiliar to some of my
readers. It is a word taken as a metaphor from
physical science, and one of the utmost value in
political geography. It is the word “potential.”</p>

<p>We talk of the “potential” between two
commercial centres, or between a capital and a
port, or between a mineral producing region
and an agricultural region, or between a region
whence barbarians desire to invade fertile
civilized land and the centre of the fertile
civilized land which desires to defend itself,
etc., etc., and our use of this word “potential”
is drawn from the doctrine of physical science
that energy in open shape, energy at work, is<span id="Page_108" class="pagenum">[108]</span>
given its opportunity by the tendency of two
points to establish a communication: the
tendency of two separate situations to establish
unity, the tendency of a hitherto “potential”&mdash;that
is, only “possible,” not yet “actual”&mdash;force
to realize itself. For instance, you will
have a highly charged electrical area tending to
discharge itself by the line of best conduction.
You will have a head of water creating a
“potential”: a reservoir a hundred feet above
the valley has to be connected with the floor of
the valley by a tube to turn the potential energy
into actual energy and to drive a turbine.</p>

<p>Now, in the development of the road system
we metaphorically use this word “potential”
in just the same fashion. For instance: there
was originally no bridge across a river because
the people in the town on one side of it had no
particular reason to cross to barren land upon
the other. The town gradually developed into
a holiday resort. The only place for a good golf
links was on the far side of the river, and visitors
who lived in the town during their holidays
wanted to go during part of the day to the
golf links. A “potential” was established. Thus
there has always been a most powerful “potential”
between London and Dover, between the
great commercial centre of the island and the
port nearest to the Continent. That is a
“potential” which has worked throughout the<span id="Page_109" class="pagenum">[109]</span>
whole of English history. We can watch other
potentials at work in different periods arising
and dying out again. For instance, during the
Norman and early Angevin period there was a
very strong “potential” between the middle
north coast of France and the coast of Sussex,
with a corresponding development of traffic.
The principal people in England were also great
land owners and officials on the coast immediately
opposite. That “potential” died down
until the revival of modern steam traffic.
Again, there is a “potential” to-day between
any coal field and any centre of consumption
of wealth distant from that coal field. So there
is between any coal field and any great port.
Again, you will have a strategic “potential.”
A particular point of no economic value may
be of the utmost strategic value. The holding
of it may make all the difference to the defenders
of the frontiers, and in that case a “potential”
exists which is the driving motive for a road
between the capital and the point in question.</p>

<p>With this note in mind we can proceed to
some sketch of the history of the English Road.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>The development of the English Road up to
the present turning-point in its history, following,
as we have seen, the political story of the
island, falls into five divisions.</p>

<p><span id="Page_110" class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p><b>A.</b>&mdash;First came the primitive trackways, the
chief of which must have been artificially
strengthened, and some of which may have
been, in sections at least, true roads up to the
Roman invasions.</p>

<p><b>B.</b>&mdash;Next came the Roman road system, which
was presumably developed in the second century
of our era. This is the framework of all
that followed. All our roads from that date
(eighteen hundred years ago) to modern times
have sprung from and have grown in connection
with this original set plan or framework.
That is true, no doubt, of all western
countries, but it is especially true of England.
The English road system is the product in every
age of the great Roman scheme, the relics of
which are more marked in England than they
are anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>This point is the master point of the whole
story. It is a point upon which popular history
has completely lost its way. Popular history
represents the Roman occupation of this island
as an accident, a sort of interlude between the
native British period and a later and separate
“English” period which arose upon the invasion
of the country by German tribes from beyond
the North Sea. That is not the history of England
at all. The history of England is the history
of a Roman province.</p>

<div id="Ref_111" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Earliest Road</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>England began by being, like everything<span id="Page_113" class="pagenum">[113]</span>
else in the North and West, barbaric. It was
civilized from the Mediterranean and made a
part of the Roman Empire&mdash;that is, of one
common civilization&mdash;one great state stretching
from the Grampians to the Euphrates, and
from the Sahara to the North Sea. This
civilizing imprint of the Roman Empire Britain
has never lost.</p>

<p>Our civilization fell into decay, as did that of
the whole of the rest of Europe. The decay
was not due to the pirate raids from North
Germany and Holland any more than it was
due to the raids of the Scottish Highlanders,
which were just as frequent and violent, or the
raids of Irish pirates from the west, which were
at one moment so severe as to put up a separate
realm on the west coast of this island. The
history of England is continuous, and its foundation,
from which we get all our institutions,
more than half our language, all our ideas and
religion and the rest of it, is in the 400 years
of high civilization between the landing of the
Roman armies and the breakdown of the imperial
system in the West.</p>

<p>The Roman Road is the true and only root
of the road system of Britain. All our local
roads can be found developing slowly from the
Roman roads of the district which had preceded
them, and it is nearly always possible to trace
the causes which led to each particular local<span id="Page_114" class="pagenum">[114]</span>
system. In each you find the Roman Road is the
backbone of the affair, and the later local roads
existing only as developments of and changes
from this basic Roman plan.</p>

<p><b>C.</b>&mdash;The third division is one for which we have
little direct, but plenty of indirect, evidence,
and the remains of which are with us upon every
side. It is the growth in the Early Middle Ages,
presumably from about the Angevin period, of
the mediaeval road system which was the deflection
and extension of the old Roman road
system. At the end of the Empire, during the
Dark Ages (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> from the fifth to the eleventh
century), though the Roman road system had
remained the only available one, it had decayed,
and numerous modifications of it had already
appeared; but with the Early Middle Ages
those modifications seem to have grown prodigiously,
and the indirect network of local
roads would then seem to have arisen.</p>

<p><b>D.</b>&mdash;The fourth chapter is even more obscure.
It is a partial decline, only affecting certain districts,
and affecting some much more than
others: a decline which corresponds more or
less to the end of the sixteenth and the beginning
of the seventeenth century. It went with the
flooding of the fen lands, with the breakdown of
central authority, the increase of local interests,
and so on.</p>

<p><b>E.</b>&mdash;The fifth chapter is the great revolution<span id="Page_115" class="pagenum">[115]</span>
in road planning and construction which may
be called the turnpike era: beginning early in
the eighteenth century and flourishing at its
close.</p>

<p>The turnpike system continued to develop
with continual changes through three or four
generations. It survived the competition of the
railroads. It was vastly improved by the new
local legislation of from forty to twenty years
ago. It left us with the road system we now
enjoy, which must, under the pressure of quite
recent changes, be modified if our communications
are to be saved, or, at any rate, to keep
pace with the present conditions of travel.</p>

System&mdash;The System of which Salisbury Plain was
the “Hub”: The System Connected with London:
Cross-Country Communications&mdash;The Three Factors
which Have Determined Travel in Britain.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The origin of the trackways is, of course,
unknown, and can only be guessed at
by inference; but their character, and
especially the geographical causes which determined
their trace, we can establish on the
largest lines with some accuracy.</p>

<p>We must not lose ourselves in that kind of
speculation which has been so dear to the
academies, and which is usually very futile. As
to the order in which the development took
place we have no evidence whatever: for
instance, as to the date of the founding of
London, or of its size before the Roman occupation;
nor have we similar evidence with
regard to any of the centres of England for the
uniting of which roads would arise. But we
have relics of the trackways before us. We have
the geographical conditions almost unchanged,
and we have the indication of Roman roads
clearly based upon particular existing trackways,<span id="Page_117" class="pagenum">[117]</span>
and therefore suggesting what the scheme
was before the Roman engineers set to work.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the British pre-Roman
road system fell into three divisions.</p>

<p>There was, first of all, a division (possibly the
earliest to develop of all) which had for its
“hub” Salisbury Plain, and from that centre a
whorl, rather than a wheel, of diverging approaches
to the coast.</p>

<p>There was, secondly, the system turning upon
the crossing of the Thames at London as a
“hub.” It is this second system which was so
largely developed in the historical period and
which still governs our main roads and railways
to-day.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there was the series of cross-communications,
of which the most important by
far was the track leaving the Exe and making
for the Humber.</p>

<p><a href="#Part_II_Sketch_III">The British trackways formed along these
three systems</a> discovered and used the best passages
of the rivers, some of which the Romans
changed, to which they added a certain number,
but which, in the main, they retained.
They also indicate, though less certainly, the
town centres which have remained through the
centuries the same, and they were also determined
by the main centres of agricultural population
and, to a much less extent, by the presence
of mines.</p>

<p><span id="Page_118" class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Part II</em>,
Sketch III, <em>Probable scheme of</em>
MAIN ORIGINAL TRACKWAYS
<em>in</em>
BARBARIC ENGLAND</p></div>
</div>

<p>The system of which Salisbury Plain appears
to have been the “hub” we presume to be the
earliest because it was dependent almost entirely
upon surface: good going over dry land. It is
to be presumed that the earliest system would
be that prevalent when men were less able to<span id="Page_119" class="pagenum">[119]</span>
give artificial aid to the Road, to harden it, to
construct causeways or approaches; when they
were less able to drain marshes; when they had
not yet cleared forests. Now, of all the soils
which make up the surface of Britain chalk is
the best surface for this purpose. It has two
characters which give it this character. In the
first place, it is self-drained and always passable
even in our wettest seasons; and, in the second
place, it does not carry tangled undergrowth,
and even its woods (which are not as a rule
continuous) are commonly of beech&mdash;the easiest
of all woods to pass through in travel, from the
absence of scrub beneath the branches.</p>

<p>It so happens that the chalk is, in this country,
distributed in great continuous lines and compact
areas which lend themselves admirably to
the development of an earlier track system.
You can follow chalk with little interruption
from the open central space, Salisbury Plain,
south-eastward to the Channel, to the Dorset
coast (“Dorset” from the country of the “Durotriges,”
a British tribe whose name survives in
that of the modern county<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>), and the first in
order of the tracks led there. The chalk could
equally be followed to the neighbourhood of
Southampton Water. A third line led along the
confused Hampshire chalk to the definite ridge<span id="Page_120" class="pagenum">[120]</span>
of the Sussex Downs, and so to the harbours of
the Sussex coast and of Kent.</p>

<p>The fourth, with some interruption, led along
the north downs to Canterbury, whence tracks
would radiate to the ports of Kent.</p>

<p>A fifth followed the Berkshire Downs and the
Chilterns, and so led on to the Wash and earlier
parts of the Norfolk coast, which have now
apparently disappeared in erosion.</p>

<p>The sixth line led with more difficulty (and
has been more obliterated by later Roman
work) directly westward to the mines of the
Mendips, and to the borders of the Severn
estuary. It could not take advantage of the
chalk beyond Wiltshire, but it had fairly dry
going along the ridge of the Mendips.</p>

<p>The seventh, it must be presumed, though
the traces are largely lost, used the height of the
Cotswolds; but here the soil, being oolitic and
not chalk, was much less favourable and the
extension northward ceased earlier.</p>

<p>This system, then, we regard as the earliest
of all.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>The second system, as I have said, seems
to have been connected with London, but here
the later track of the Roman engineers and the
continuous development of nearly twenty centuries
has left us little to go on save conjecture.<span id="Page_121" class="pagenum">[121]</span>
There are points in that conjecture, however,
which are fairly certain. But there seems to
have been, from the earliest time, communication
between north and south on the lowest
crossing of the Thames. Now, the lowest permanent
crossing of the Thames, even before a
bridge, was in the neighbourhood of London.</p>

<p>The crossing of a river is determined by
the hardness of the land upon either bank, as
we have seen, more than by any other factor.
The lower Thames everywhere had extensive
marshes either upon one side or the other, and
usually upon both. At Grays, Tilbury, Erith,
etc., the hard ground approached right up to
one bank, but was always countered by extensive
marshes on the other, or by marsh
behind gravel, forming a sort of island of hard
land which could not be used for continuous
travel.</p>

<p>The first good crossing-place was at Lambeth,
and it is generally assumed that the earliest of
all the tracks took the stream here, for the alignment
of the main approach from Kent through
Canterbury, Rochester, and Shooters’ Hill does
not point at the centre of London, but at
Lambeth. This, it is presumed, was the track
followed by what is now Park Lane, and so
ultimately north-westward by the Edgware
Road and its continuations to Chester, with a
branch thrown off through the pass between<span id="Page_122" class="pagenum">[122]</span>
the marshes of the Mersey and the Pennine
range in the district of Manchester, and so on
through Lancashire. But at some very early
stage there was established a crossing below
Lambeth in the neighbourhood of London
Bridge, even before that bridge came into
existence. It is true that there is here a belt of
marsh on the right bank, but the considerable
gravelly hill on the left, or north, bank there
would give an opportunity not to be lost. It had
three great advantages: it was a large area of
dry land for settlement; it had defences all
round it&mdash;marshy land to the north, the Fleet
to the west, the Lea to the east; it had a considerable
area for the drawing up of boats, and
a steep shore for wharfage. Under these conditions,
whenever men could first construct a
causeway it would have been worth while to
have been at that labour across the Southwark
marshes in order to establish a permanent crossing
by ferry, and later by a bridge, upon the
site of London Bridge. At any rate, from that
centre&mdash;London Bridge&mdash;at some very early
period you get trackways radiating.</p>

<p>There is the main one, in the first place,
through Canterbury to Dover and the Kentish
ports. Next, there is the eastern one to Colchester,
along which the chief Roman invasion
marched to the capture of that town, which was
the capital of the enemy.</p>

<h3>iii</h3>

<p>Next, we may presume (for evidence is lost,
especially under the later Roman work) there
was a track towards the centre of Norfolk.
Next there was some great road going northward
east of the Pennines, following the dry
land which skirts the Fens and reaching the
great fertile plain of York, and so on northward
through Durham up to the crossings of the
Tyne. Where this original main track went we
cannot say. We know the trace of the Roman
road which followed it. We may presume that
the divagations and modifications of this road
of the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages, which
ultimately built up our main road to the north,
reverted in some degree to the original track.
But the whole thing is guess-work. One thing
seems fairly certain: this eastern road to the
north (the twin to the great north-western road
by Chester to Lancashire) must have split about
half way to York, one branch making directly
to the plain of York itself, the other obviously
running along the inevitable ridge which
points right north through Lincolnshire to the
Humber. There is here no bridge possible. It
is not too broad for a ferry. But though the
Roman road, superseding the earlier trackway,
went on northward, it is a fair guess that the
original trackway stopped at the river.</p>

<p>Of cross roads we have fragments, of course,<span id="Page_126" class="pagenum">[126]</span>
in the Pennines, but we know nothing of their
history. It is clear that the main cross communications
between the peopled area of the
Yorkshire Plain and that of the Lancashire
Plain must have gone over by Shipley&mdash;the
obvious gap in the chain. But more we cannot
tell. That is the natural way, and there was, so
to speak, no avoiding it. What was mainly used
further south we cannot tell. It was a tangled
land. There is no clear and certain trace of
cross communications which must have existed
across the Midlands south of Trent. We do not
know what great patches of wood may here
have determined the windings of an original
road. There are no serious obstacles (it is high
land and dry, with no marshes or large watercourses),
but there was less reason for continual
traffic here from east to west than there was for
traffic from north to south; therefore there was
less “potential” than was created by the traffic
on cross communications further south.</p>

<p>The original system of tracks radiating from
Salisbury Plain was simple. They led, in radiating
lines straight and curved, directly to the
lower Thames, to the ports of the Channel, to
the southern estuaries, to the north-east&mdash;that is,
to the Wash&mdash;and to the north direct by the
Cotswolds. But true cross communication was
lacking to this set, and was provided by the
great road from the Exe to the Humber, which<span id="Page_127" class="pagenum">[127]</span>
still survives in the form of the Fosse Way. It
runs throughout the whole of our history, from
very long before the first records nearly to the
present day, and is to-day traceable throughout,
and used in many places as a hard road. This
main track was one of the dominant factors in
the character of English travel. It has decayed
under modern conditions because its “potential”
has gone. There is no driving power to-day
urging travel from south-west to north-east,
and it is only in partial experiments and the
linking up of separate lines that even our railway
system serves that end. But before modern
times the Fosse Way played a very great part.
For some reason there was a perpetual necessity
for passing from the south-west&mdash;Devon and
Dorset&mdash;to the north-east coast. Two permanent
potentials, that between north and south
and that between east and west, help to explain
the Fosse Way.</p>

<p>England has always tended to fall into two
cross divisions&mdash;a northern and a southern one,
separated at first by climate (the northern more
rude, the southern more gentle), then by agricultural
conditions, the northern far less peopled,
the southern more peopled and more wealthy;
and to an eastern and western division separated
by type of landscape, to some extent by climate,
always to some extent by soil, difference in
race, emphasized whenever an invasion came<span id="Page_128" class="pagenum">[128]</span>
from the Welsh lands on the one side or from
the North Sea on the other. The Fosse Way
broke both those cross divisions and was a sort
of “reinforcement” (as they say in modern
concrete), taking the strain of cross tension
across the island.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>In this short sketch of what were in some
cases certainly, in others only presumably, the
original British main tracks we have to note
three factors which have always determined
travel in Britain: the centres of internal
economic production, the ports, and the Channel
crossings.</p>

<p>Before the modern industrial system the
economic centres of production were the wheat
lands, and these were the open land of which
Winchester was the centre, the Dorchester
centre, Somerset, certain separate centres in the
Midlands (separated by great woods which
have disappeared and their exact site not certain),
the Cheshire Plain, the Lancashire Plain,
the great Yorkshire Plain, and last, and most
important of all, East Anglia&mdash;the central
Eastern plain (Essex in particular) was the
granary of the early time in England. Tracks
connected all these places: they also connected
the centres of population with the ports. Every
one of the tracks makes ultimately from port to<span id="Page_129" class="pagenum">[129]</span>
port. You have a connection through London
(earlier perhaps, as we have seen, through Lambeth)
between the port of Kent and the north-western
ports (of which Chester is the great
original example and Liverpool the modern);
between the north-eastern ports of the Humber
and the Tyne, and the south-western ports at
Southampton Water and Poole (which was of
great early importance, and whence we shall
find a Roman road starting). Further west the
mouth of the Exe was a more important
approach to Britain in the past than it is now.
You have also the estuary of the Severn, ill provided
with natural harbours but forming in its
upper reaches a harbour of its own, with the
peculiar advantage of the lower Avon, with a
secure pool at Bristol approached by the curious
and exceptional gorge at Clifton.</p>

<p>Lastly, you have the great port formed by the
crossing place at London, made, as we have
seen, by the tendency of early travel, right up
to the appearance of railways, to penetrate a
country as far as possible by its waterways and
to carry cargoes well inland, because water
carriage was so much cheaper than land transport.</p>

<p>The third factor&mdash;that of river crossing&mdash;also
has its effect, though a lesser one, upon the
trace of the old British ways. If, for instance,
you carry along any one of the tracks which<span id="Page_130" class="pagenum">[130]</span>
follow the chalk you will see how carefully the
water crossings were picked. It is the characteristic
of chalk that the rivers lie transverse to it,
cutting gorges through the hills, and each
of these crossing places was chosen where
hard land approached from either side. The
chalk (and the sand associated with it) provides
at certain points in the valleys twin spurs
approaching the water on either side; hence
you have the track along the north downs
crossing the Wey at St. Catherine’s Chapel
(and alternatively by Guildford); and, again,
the Mole at Pixham, near Dorking, and the
Medway at Snodland (with an alternative at
Rochester). The southern track along the
Hampshire and Sussex Downs takes the Arun
at a similar advantage and opportunity at
Houghton, and alternatively at Arundel. It
takes the Adur at Bramber, the Ouse at Lewes.</p>

<p>This vague sketch of the old trackways is all
that we can lay down so far as their main lines
are concerned, and it is very imperfect, but
we must bear it in mind in order to understand
the Roman system, which was largely based
upon those trackways and which superseded
them.</p>

<p>There was one kind of soil, and one only,
which could compete with the chalk as good
going for primitive travel, and that was sand.
Had we sand in continuous lines in Britain it<span id="Page_131" class="pagenum">[131]</span>
would have given a dry passage for the trackways,
and here and there advantage is taken of
it by such trackways. But sand, in point of fact,
is not to be found in these continuous lines. It
comes in patches, and hence we cannot talk of
any one of the great trackways as dependent
upon a sandy soil. The chief exception that
I can call to mind in this respect is the run
of the old Pilgrims’ Way&mdash;a prehistoric track
from the neighbourhood of Farnham to the
crossing of the Mole, near Dorking. Though
chalk lay on the main direction, it seems to have
preferred the southern dry sand to the chalk
immediately north of it, and it keeps to the
sand until the cessation of that formation a short
distance west of the Mole. There is here a
curious piece of political geology which has
been, I think, of great effect upon the history
of England. Had the ridges of sand through
the weald of Sussex been <em>continuous</em>, the weald
would have been developed early. Its iron
industry would have furnished a basis for export,
and it would have become one of the centres of
population. There are ridges of sand which you
can trace all the way through the weald from
close by the Hampshire chalk in the neighbourhood
of Midhurst right away to the valley of the
Rother. But they are not continuous, and the
interruptions are formed of deep clay, impossible
to pass in winter. The result of that lack of continuity<span id="Page_132" class="pagenum">[132]</span>
has been that no such track ever developed
through the weald of Sussex. Sussex,
therefore, owing to the stiff clay of its weald,
remained cut off from the rest of England, and
that throughout all the Dark Ages. It falls out
of the national history. Indeed, the linking up
of Sussex with the north was only effected by
the Romans at the cost of great labour through
the artificial causeway of the Stane Street between
Chichester and London; and after the breakdown
of western civilization in the fifth century
there was no regular approach to the southern
coast from the Thames valley in a direct line.
The traffic either went westward down towards
Southampton, Hampshire, Dorset, and Devon
or eastward to the Straits of Dover. The
Norman Conquest and the rule of the Angevins
restored Sussex to something of its rightful
place in English communications because the
coast of that county lay immediately opposite
the centre of the foreign region which then
governed England, but the interlude was not
lengthy. In the later Middle Ages and on to
quite modern times (to the middle of the
eighteenth century) the interruption due to the
clay made itself felt again, and only the railway
and great increase of population have been able
between them to restore direct and frequent
communication between the Thames valley and
this part of the southern coast.</p>

Engineer: The Theory and Practice of the Straight Line:
Modifications of the Straight Line: How it was Carried

<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The making of the great Roman roads
was the one great initiative in the story
of English communications: it originated
all that followed, and there was no new
real development, no essentially new departure
between the planning of that military scheme
and the coming of the railway. It can only
be compared to what the future may have
to show if we find ourselves able to reform our
roads as they should be reformed for the new
conditions of modern travel, and even this
change would not be anything like as great as
the change made by the throwing of those
great highways to stand for ever across a
country which had hitherto been half barbarous.</p>

<p><a href="#Part_II_Sketch_IV">The Roman Road had a structure and
character of its own</a> which it has retained to the
present day, so that even where it was only the<span id="Page_134" class="pagenum">[134]</span>
straightening and the strengthening of an old
trackway upon which it was founded it would
follow the mark of the Roman engineers
throughout all that remained of its course. It
was essentially a piece of <em>building</em>, and in this the
Roman Road differed from every other form of
communication before the modern railways. It
had to be of this kind on account of two things
which the Roman military engineers particularly
desired to serve, both of them connected
with the military character of the west.
First, they wanted a platform, raised, as a rule,
above the surrounding country, so that troops
passing along it should be the less liable to
attack: so that a view could be had from it over
the immediate surroundings, which were cleared:
and so that any sudden stroke against a marching
column could be checked. The raising of
the way had other objects, of course&mdash;it kept the
surface dry, for instance&mdash;but the main object
was that of security upon the march, and the
same object was one of the reasons for making
the roads as a rule in straight lengths or limbs,
sometimes two, three, or even four days’ march
in extent. A road was planned without windings,
so as to be safer from ambush and surprise,
and where it had coupled to its straightness its
elevation above the surrounding country the
chance of ambush or surprise was almost
eliminated.</p>

<p><span id="Page_135" class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<div id="Part_II_Sketch_IV" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Part II</em>,
Sketch IV, <em>The</em>
ROMAN ROAD
SCHEME</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the habit the Roman military engineers
had of driving their roads in these great straight
limbs, which are still so clearly marked, served
many other purposes besides this military one of
which I speak. It has been condemned as a
waste of effort, for it is clear that a winding<span id="Page_136" class="pagenum">[136]</span>
road, avoiding steep gradients and turning
difficulties of marsh or wood, requires less effort
to construct, mile for mile, than an artificially
straight one; and that even when you have
allowed for the extra length of a winding road,
the formula of least effort will never give you a
long straight. But your straight road has <em>the
great advantage of rapid planning</em>.</p>

<p>The Roman engineers, especially in the
north&mdash;that is, in Belgium, Gaul, and in
Britain&mdash;were working under campaign conditions,
or in countries but recently occupied.
They were under an imperative necessity of
providing good communications as quickly as
possible, and <em>for that object</em> the straight road was
obviously the best. Once you had determined
the two points which you had to join, you
established a track between them and carried
it over all but the worst obstacles, taking all but
the worst gradients. If you met marsh, you
built a causeway; whenever you came to a
river crossing, you threw your bridge; when
you came to a sharp, narrow ridge you made a
cutting. All that meant labour, but as in any
case you were intending to make a great built,
constructed, raised structure along the whole
trajectory the extra labour involved in a
straight trace was not proportionally as heavy
as it would be for one of our ephemeral modern
roads. In other words, the Roman engineers<span id="Page_137" class="pagenum">[137]</span>
set out upon a plan necessarily expensive. They
set out to make a great public monument, as it
were; and the extra expense of its straightness
did not weigh in the bill.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>A modification of this tendency to straight
lines is found proceeding from three causes.
First, where and when an established track
already existed and the Roman work was only
required to harden and strengthen it. Even
there the Roman engineers would straighten
portions which were too winding to fit in their
scheme. But, apparently, where the track
was fully established they tolerated a good many
curves, especially if their work came some time
after the conquest, when the land was settled.</p>

<p>The second modification of the plan is to be
found in hilly countries. In the mountains or
very hilly regions the Roman engineers of
necessity gave up the straight line, and as these
regions were also the districts where on the
heights large garrisons were least necessary they
were the better able to abandon their general
military plan.</p>

<p>If you look at a detailed map of the Roman
road system in Gaul or Britain you will see how
the moment it comes to a broken district the
straight lines are replaced by a waving trace
such as you would have in a modern English<span id="Page_138" class="pagenum">[138]</span>
road. For instance, beyond the Fosse in Dorsetshire
and Devon the Roman coast road is as
winding as any modern road can be. The same
is true of the crossings of the Apennines, and,
of course, of the crossings of the Alps and the
Pyrenees. It seems to be equally true of the
Ardennes gorges, but the trace here is often so
much obliterated that it is difficult to say exactly
how the Romans dealt with that mixed problem
of wood and ravine.</p>

<p>The third modification was that of gradient.
The Roman Road would take a very steep
gradient indeed; but there was a limit, and
when the slope was too steep the road diverged
or zig-zagged, or took a combe in a great curve,
or swept round the base of a hill. We have
examples of all these points upon the map of
England, the best of which, I think, are the
great sweep of the Stane Street on Bignor Hill
in Sussex and the great loop round Down Barn,
north of Andover, on the road from Winchester
to Glo’ster.</p>

<p>The greatest ingenuity was shown by the
planners of the Roman roads in the choice of
trace. Granted that you were to make a trajectory
of many days’ march in large straight
limbs, each limb had to be thought out very
carefully, straight though it was, to yield something
like a minimum of effort. You had to
make your turning-points, or hinges, in the<span id="Page_139" class="pagenum">[139]</span>
system at places where the straight lines joining
them would cross water or hilly country to the
best advantage, and it is astonishing with what
skill these terminal points of the straight limbs
were chosen. For instance, that one road of
them all which has been most certainly of purely
military use and designed to join Chichester with
London (all of which I have worked out some
years ago and on which I have written a monograph),<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
has its first bend from Chichester,
just after the end of the first day’s march at the
crossing of the Arun on Burgh Hill. The angle
of the bend is one of seventeen degrees, the
direction is north by twenty-two degrees east.
Now, this direction of the two limbs which join
at Burgh Hill exactly secures two things essential
to the minimum of effort. One plain straight
from Chichester to Leith Hill would have involved
heavy effort in gradients and water.
This plan of two limbs meeting at the Arun
crossing gives every advantage:</p>

<p>(1) It makes the road cross the intervening
range of the downs just where, by a slight curve,
a reasonable gradient can be used;</p>

<p>(2) It makes it cross water and marsh at the
narrowest point between Hardham and Pulborough,
and at the same time just avoids the
double water crossing of the Arun and the
Rother. It is true that there is here something<span id="Page_140" class="pagenum">[140]</span>
of a coincidence, but it was plan and survey
which discovered that coincidence.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>How were these great straight limbs plotted
out? That is a question which has been fully
debated but not yet settled. Where two ends of
a trajectory were in sight one from the other
the matter was simple enough; but what was
the method used when the straight line exceeded
the horizon: when it was carried on, for instance,
for more than thirty miles, as is the case over
and over again in the great north-eastern road
from Paris to Cologne, and in the road from
Amiens to Boulogne? What was the method
when, even for lesser distances, one end of
the trajectory could not be seen from the
other on account of intervening hills, or where
in flat land forests were sufficient to impede the
view?</p>

<p>One theory has been that of smoke signals, a
method which has been found of use, I believe,
in barbarous countries in our own day. We
must, I think, certainly reject it in such a
climate as ours. Such signals could only here
be used upon a few days in the year, specially
picked, and the Roman engineers would not
have depended upon the caprice of the weather.
There has also been suggested (I adopted that
suggestion myself in the monograph of which<span id="Page_141" class="pagenum">[141]</span>
I have just spoken) the use of high movable
platforms, but I now think that this also should
be rejected on account of its clumsiness, and of
the fact that in an uncleared country it would
often be quite impractical. The most probable
method was suggested to me by a correspondent
some years ago, based upon his own experience
in the planning of roads in new countries. It is
the method of <em>odds and evens</em>, and requires some
description with the aid of a simple plan.</p>

<p>Suppose that you have to construct a straight
line from <span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> not being visible
one from the other, and the distance between
them being considerable. If you have plenty of
men with which to work (and the Roman military
commanders did not lack these), you will
proceed as follows: You send out your men
from either end, in two chains as it were, each
individual easily in sight of his next neighbour,
but not nearer to him than is necessary for the
observation of signals. These chains of men
are either directed from the two ends of the
line, or, if you can work only from one end,
you send them out from that end, instructing
the head of the chain when he comes in sight
of the other end to work towards it and establish
himself there. At the end of the process,
whether you have been working with two lines
approaching each other from either end and
joining hands in the middle, or from one end<span id="Page_142" class="pagenum">[142]</span>
only, you will end up with a line which will
certainly not be straight&mdash;on the contrary,
very irregular&mdash;but which will at least join
your two goals. Probably, if you had been
working from both ends, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, you would
have something like <a href="#Part_II_Sketch_VI">sketch VI</a>; while if you
be working from one end only&mdash;<span class="smcap">A</span>&mdash;the head
of your column would probably be widely
out at the conclusion of your experiment.
Your column would have to double back
sharply on to its goal when at last it was
caught sight of, and you will have some such
trace as on <a href="#Part_II_Sketch_VI">sketch V</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, having established this rough<span id="Page_143" class="pagenum">[143]</span>
winding line, you next make the men number
themselves as a line does when it is dressing, by
odds and evens, or by ones and twos, so that the
first, third, fifth, seventh man, etc., counting
from one end make one lot, or all the ones make
one lot, if you are going by ones and twos&mdash;and
the second, fourth, sixth, eighth man, and so on,
make another lot. You bid one of these sets&mdash;say
the odds&mdash;to face towards one goal&mdash;say
<span class="smcap">B</span>&mdash;and the other set to face towards the other
goal&mdash;<span class="smcap">A</span>. Lastly, you bid them space themselves
out so that any individual of one set can
at least clearly see his fellow in the same set
along the direction to which he faces, and the<span id="Page_144" class="pagenum">[144]</span>
man of the other set in between. For instance,
No. 39, looking south towards <span class="smcap">B</span>, must be able
to see No. 37, who is facing the same way as
he is, and must at the same time be able to see
No. 38, who is facing towards him; similarly,
No. 38 must be able to see No. 40 clearly, and
No. 39 in between. It is clear that in thick,
“blind” country (as, for instance, in woods or
in tumbled land) your men will have to stand
fairly close together. But in open country they
can be at considerable distances&mdash;up to half
a mile or more; so long as every unit can see
the next unit of the same set clearly, and have
his signals received by the unit of the other
set in between, the conditions are satisfied.
Your line being thus instructed (and, as anyone
may discover in practice, it is not a very long
business once the first rough chain has been
established), <em>the numbers of each set signal to the
intervening numbers of the other set alternatively
to move to right or left</em> until a straight line is
locally established.</p>

</div>

<p>For instance, in <a href="#Part_II_Sketch_VII">sketch VII</a> you begin with
the “evens,” looking northward. No. 38, looking
north towards No. 40, sees that No. 39
(who faces him, looking south) is somewhat too
much to the east and does not stand properly
between him and No. 40. He signals to No. 39
to move westward as along the dots until No. 39
is at a new position, shown by the dotted circle<span id="Page_145" class="pagenum">[145]</span>
exactly between No. 38 and No. 40. Next,
No. 36 signals to No. 37, who is too much to
the west, until No. 37 is exactly between himself
and No. 38. When this has been done all along
the line by the evens the order is given to the
odds to repeat the process from their new
positions. No. 39, looking southward from his
new position at the dotted circle, sees that No.
38 is too far to the east to be in perfect alignment
with No. 39’s next odd neighbour No. 37,
at whom he is looking, southward. No. 39
signals, therefore, to No. 38, who is looking
northward, to move westward, and No. 38 does
so until the signal stops him, when he is just in line
between the new positions of No. 39 and No. 37.</p>

<p>It will be evident that after this first stage of
the process the original irregular line between
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> will have been much straightened.
You have but to repeat the manœuvre half a
dozen or a dozen times to get the whole body
of men into a strictly straight line between the
two extremities many miles apart, and that
although those in the middle cannot see either
extreme and neither extremity can see the other.
In theory this method can be used for an indefinite
extent of country. In practice it seems
to have been used (if it were indeed that upon
which the Roman engineers relied) for spaces
sometimes as great as a three days’ march, and
quite often as great as one day’s march or more.</p>

<p>The scheme of Roman roads, following in the
main these great straight limbs, covered the
whole country, and was for the most part completed,
we may presume, by the end of the
second century.</p>

<p>It must not, of course, be imagined that these
great military ways were the only means of
communication in Roman times. Many historians
have fallen into that grotesque error,
with the result that history becomes meaningless
to their readers. These great ways were only the
main arteries, which were linked up in all the
intervening spaces by a mass of local ways not
specially constructed or engineered&mdash;most of
them presumably aboriginal, and also maintained
presumably by a local authority.</p>

coming of the New Civilization in the Twelfth Century.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The next phase in the development of
the English Road is the very gradual
breakdown of the great Roman ways.
The Dark Ages&mdash;that is, the 500 or 600 years
between the fifth and the tenth or eleventh
centuries&mdash;formed the period during which this
process took place.</p>

<p>The Roman Road in England suffered the
fate of all our ancient civilization. It very slowly
declined and coarsened, but it remained the one
necessary means of communication. We have no
dates and no contemporary record after the
fourth century for Britain, but we have the
analogy of Northern France, in which we know
that the upkeep and repair of the great Roman
roads continued until well into the seventh century,
and we have the evidence of the Roman
roads as they now stand before us, with the result
of their very gradual and only partial breakdown<span id="Page_148" class="pagenum">[148]</span>
in a use of centuries. We have also the
fact that much the most of the great battles took
place on or near the Roman roads until the
twelfth century, that most of the new great
monastic and other houses were built near them,
or on them, and that the ports most commonly
used in the Dark Ages were nearly always
ports with a Roman road serving them. We can
thereby roughly judge (although we have no
direct evidence) what happened to the system.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Roman Road was so
solidly built that centuries of neglect did not
entirely destroy its usefulness. Sections of each
road disappeared: some from causes which are
easily explicable, some under the most obscure
conditions the causes of which it seems impossible
to discover. Every great Roman road
in Europe, and even those in Britain (which are
better preserved than those in the most part
of the Continent) shows these gaps. Sometimes
a whole great section of road will almost
entirely disappear&mdash;more often it is a stretch of
a few miles. Thus the whole of the short cut
through Penkridge to Chester, which certainly
existed and some elements of which can be
reconstituted, has disappeared; so that most
maps of Roman Britain erroneously mark the
connection between London and Chester as
going round by Shrewsbury. As an example of
a short part utterly disappearing, one can take<span id="Page_149" class="pagenum">[149]</span>
any one out of hundreds; the best example
near London (typical of many others) is the gap
in the Roman road between the Epsom racecourse
and Merton. The road is evident as a
clearly marked high embankment above the
steep rise at Juniper Hill near the Dorking
road to within a mile of Epsom racecourse.
Then it suddenly ceases. There is no change in
the soil. It is on chalk before and after its disappearance;
and yet, just here, at about a mile
from Epsom racecourse, it completely and
totally disappears. There is no trace even of
its foundation left from thence onwards northwards
until you get to the site at Merton (which
was state land and almost certainly the last
camp and halting-place on the road before
London).</p>

<p>How the road crossed the marshes of the
Wandle we can only conjecture, as we can only
conjecture where it lay exactly between Epsom
and those marshes. Why it should disappear in
the marshes is evident enough. The causeway
sank in. Why it should disappear under the
plough to the south of the marshes, as Roman
roads nearly always do on arable land, can also
be explained. But why it should wholly disappear
on the last mile or two of chalk is inexplicable.
One theory put forward is that in
the great wars of the Dark Ages portions of the
road were deliberately destroyed to impede the<span id="Page_150" class="pagenum">[150]</span>
progress of an enemy, just as a railway may be
destroyed in modern warfare. But this theory
will hardly hold water. The gaps that have disappeared
thus, often come just where you have
the best soil for marching independently of
artifice, and where, therefore, an interruption of
them would least incommode an advance. For
instance, they are perpetually found on high
chalk; and, further, the disappearance is hardly
ever connected with a defensive position.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the development
of the English road system much the most
interesting point in the fate which befell the
Roman roads is to be found at the crossings of
rivers, especially of rivers which have marshy
banks or flow through wood or sodden valleys.
The neglected Roman embankment across the
marsh fell out of use in the Dark Ages. Probably
the bridge first broke down, and the barbarous
time had not the energy or skill to repair
it; then the mere process of time caused the
swallowing up of the Roman viaduct, unrelieved
by repair, in all marshy land. It is difficult to
affirm a negative, but I can recall not one
example of a long Roman viaduct still wholly
in use across such an approach to water.</p>

<div id="Ref_151" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Derelict Road</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Scottish Highlands</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>What happened, then, in these sections was
this. The bridge and the viaduct disappeared
in the Dark Ages&mdash;that is, some time between
the fourth and the eleventh centuries. Sometimes<span id="Page_153" class="pagenum">[153]</span>
this gap led to the complete isolation of
the district immediately concerned. The best
example I know of this is the breakdown of the
crossing of the Arun at Romans Wood, in the
county of Sussex. There the Roman road was
a hard causeway over very thick clay land, quite
impassable for armies in winter, and rapidly
overgrown by oak scrub and thorn when
neglected. The result of the breaking down of
the Roman bridge at the “Romans Wood”
crossing was to isolate West Sussex. There was
no other way from the north, for the clay and
thorn scrub rapidly arose and obliterated the
road. It was in use as far south from London as
Ockley; but the breakdown of the bridge at
Alfoldean broke the continuity further on, and
that, I believe, is one of the reasons why Sussex
was so isolated as only to be converted to the
Christian religion a hundred years later than the
rest of the country.</p>

<p>But to return to the behaviour of the Roman
Road in the marshy approaches of a river. I say
that the embankment having been swallowed
up and the bridge broken, the men of the Dark
Ages had to find for themselves some new way
of crossing, and it is interesting to note that they
here fell back upon the primitive methods common
before Roman civilization came. They
abandoned the straight line and picked their
way by the driest bits they could find, so that<span id="Page_154" class="pagenum">[154]</span>
the new crossing of the marshy district grew up
sinuous and haphazard. Later, when the new
road system developed with the Middle Ages,
this new road was often straightened and a new
bridge thrown across the river upon its line;
but, save for a very few exceptions, the Roman
approach had disappeared.</p>

<p>There are scores of examples of this up and
down the country. The most prominent usually
bear such names as Stamford, Stanford, Stafford,
Stratford, Stretford, etc., all of which come
either from the word “street” or the word
“stone,” coupled with the word “ford.” They
thus signify that in the valleys of the river the
“going” or passage had been hardened artificially
with stone derived from Roman work.
A very good example of the way in which the
newer track replaced the older one is to be
found at Stamford, in Northamptonshire. The
<a href="#Part_II_Sketch_IX">accompanying sketch</a> shows the trace of the
Roman road from its leaving Burghley Park to
the old crossing of the river and beyond. There
are still broken traces of the old embankment on
the north side of the stream, but it is clear that
this straight line across the marsh broke down,
that a new way was picked out and slowly
hardened, and a new bridge built to suit it.
What the men of the Dark Ages did here was
to keep to the drier patches to the east where
a ford crossed the river, and then curve round<span id="Page_155" class="pagenum">[155]</span>
again westward, again to join the road on the
heights north of the river. This new passage
took over the name of the “Stone” ford, where
the old road had crossed. A bridge was thrown
in due time across the new ford, and the town
shifted towards the new bridge and acquired
its new name from the crossing.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Part II</em>,

</div>

<p>One form of the Roman Road, and one only&mdash;a
very rare form&mdash;never disappears: it is the<span id="Page_156" class="pagenum">[156]</span>
cutting through hard sand. Here and there in
England&mdash;I know not how often, but I have
myself found few traces of them; I should doubt
if there were much more than a dozen&mdash;you get
a clear cutting upon a Roman road serving no
modern or useful purpose, and almost certainly
dating from the construction of the way. There
is the trace of the one at Ashurst, near my home&mdash;that
with which I am most familiar and which
I have measured most carefully. If the cutting
be made in dry sandy soil of fair consistency
and hardness, it can remain almost indefinitely
with an unmistakable outline. There may
naturally have been many other cuttings originally
in softer or more yielding soils which have
got filled up, but the only ones I know are
through sand, which soil also tends to form those
sharp ridges through which a cutting might
suggest itself as more economical than a too
steep gradient.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>The Roman Road not only disappears through
causes which I have called inexplicable and
under the obvious influence of marsh or of cultivation,
it also fell into disuse, even where it
did not disappear, for reasons both explicable
and inexplicable. There are cases where the
falling into disuse is frankly not to be explained,
though these I have found mainly upon the<span id="Page_157" class="pagenum">[157]</span>
Continent. For instance, in the road from
Rheims to Chalons you have the Roman road
running almost parallel to the later road, the
later trace having been made for no reason that
we can discover&mdash;not serving any new towns or
villages&mdash;a mere duplicate of the old way. But
there are more cases where the disuse of a
section of the Roman Road can clearly be explained
by the need for visiting centres of
population, production, and commerce. The
Roman system for the serving of places off the
main straight road was by side roads perpendicular
to the main road. The relics of these you
still see on many of the Continental roads&mdash;a
direct perpendicular lane or avenue joining up
the château and its dependencies or the neighbouring
town with the main highway. When
the Dark Ages came and the main roads degraded,
the by-lanes and paths which had grown
up as offshoots to them and which led to the
estates and villages and towns and ports and
quarries, etc., to one side or the other of the
Road came to be used more frequently. The
main travel between distant towns was less, the
local travel grew more important in proportion.
And as this development proceeded sections
of the Roman Road tended to fall into
disuse. The local roads would be maintained
and the section of main road would be left
unrepaired.</p>

<p><span id="Page_158" class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>We have seen that the main cause of the
breaking down of the Roman Road was marsh
and the crossing of river valleys. Not only was
this process true of natural marshes, especially
at the sides of a river, it was true of a special
case which is reproduced over and over
again on the map of England, and for which
I will take as a particular example a <a href="#Part_II_Sketch_X">very
fine case near Norton Park</a>, in Northamptonshire.</p>

<div id="Part_II_Sketch_X" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Part II</em>,
Sketch X</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here the Watling Street, the great Roman
road from London to the north-west, crossed
the valley of an insignificant stream; there
was no marsh originally, and there is none to-day.
There was only a small running of water,
over which a culvert was thrown. The stream
ran under the main Roman embankment
through this culvert. Now, when the Dark
Ages came and the roads fell into disrepair the
first things to go, naturally, were the culverts.
They got blocked up. Once they got blocked
up the water dammed up on the higher side and
began to undermine the embankment. By the
time this had made the road, though still standing,
impassable, travel had found a new way,
usually <em>down the stream</em> away from the mere thus
formed. Further centuries and the recovery of
civilization cleared the ground: the embankment
either was washed away or swallowed up
in the mere and its subsequent marsh, the<span id="Page_159" class="pagenum">[159]</span>
stream resumed its original course, the dry
ground reappeared, but the trace of the Roman
road upon either side across the depression was
lost for ever and there was substituted for it the
modern road, making a curve out of the direct
line and only recovering it again after the
obstacle had been passed.</p>

<p><span id="Page_160" class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>The gradual decay of the Roman Road in the
Dark Ages was not everywhere the same, and
the consequence is that the remaining fragments
of Roman roads are connected in different
ways with the modern road system which
gradually grew out of them.</p>

<p>There are four types&mdash;overlapping, of course&mdash;of
the fate attaching to the Roman roads of
this country. They are, as I have said, the
root of all our road system. All English roads
subsequent to the period of the Roman occupation
have grown out of the great network laid
down for ever by the Roman engineers. But
the fortune which the original road suffered, the
way in which a modern system developed from
it, were not uniform. There were four divergent
developments, which ran thus:</p>

<p>(1) The Roman Road is preserved as a basis
of the modern road, and remains a main artery:
of this the great example is the Watling Street,
in the first few days’ marches north-west of
London.</p>

<p>(2) The Roman Road remains clearly the
basis of the system of local roads which developed
from it, and, though disappearing in
sections, is, upon the whole, preserved; of
these the great example is the Stane Street
road from Chichester to London.</p>

<p>(3) The Roman Road, having produced a<span id="Page_161" class="pagenum">[161]</span>
system of local roads based upon it, has almost
entirely disappeared and has left the local
system alone to witness to its original importance,
just as filigree work remains after you
have melted away the core of wax upon which
it was built. Examples of this are very difficult
to discover, precisely because the original
country has gone. But the process can be
followed here and there by a careful examination,
and I think that, upon the whole, the best
example is that of the series of roads which
grew up out of the short cut between Penkridge
and Chester.</p>

<p>(4) The Roman Road remains, in some parts
at least, but, its original purpose having been
such that it was of no continual use in the Dark
Ages, the local system of roads can only indirectly
be referred to it. Of this the great
example is the famous Peddars Way, running
through East Anglia.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>(1) The preservation of the Watling Street as
an example of a continuously used Roman road
for several days’ march north-west of London is
due to various causes.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was very little interrupted
by marsh. It ran everywhere on dry land, and the
main cause of breakdown&mdash;the swallowing up
of a causeway after the destruction of its bridge&mdash;did<span id="Page_162" class="pagenum">[162]</span>
not affect it. But this is the least of the
causes which have preserved this piece of road.</p>

<p>Second, and more important, was the establishment
along it of set stations which remained
inhabited, and the chain of which was not
interrupted by active warfare. Watling Street
here presents very interesting evidence of what
really happened during those early pirate raids
which are generally, but erroneously, called the
Anglo-Saxon Conquest. They did not so
seriously disturb the life of the country as to
break down this main artery of communication.
It lies transverse to the raids, and yet it was
maintained. And in this connection we must
also note the continued importance of London.</p>

<p>Great Roman towns suffered, of course, from
the pirate raids between (somewhat before) the
year 500 and the year 600, as did all the rest of
the island. They suffered not only from those
raids of pirates across the North Sea, but also
from the raids of pirates from Ireland, and also
from the raids of Highlanders coming over the
wall from the north. But though they suffered
they kept their place in the national scheme.
No province in the Roman Empire lost less of
its town sites in the Dark Ages than did
England. No part of Europe has so large a
number of old towns based upon Roman
foundations: and London was the chief of
them all. London may have been disturbed by<span id="Page_163" class="pagenum">[163]</span>
the raids&mdash;it probably was. There was probably
a certain amount of looting from time to
time, and a good deal of fighting outside its
walls, but it always maintained its permanence,
its character of being the economic centre of the
island. It is particularly noticeable that every
great Roman road out of London has remained
intact, and Watling Street beyond others.</p>

<p>The third cause of survival was probably the
excellence of the original construction, though
here we must hesitate a little because we cannot
but note that the Great North Road to York,
which was quite as important and which was
twin to the north-western road, has suffered
very grievous modification indeed. But there
can be no doubt that the construction of the
Watling Street was very thorough, and that this
expenditure of economic effort preserved it
through the Dark Ages as much as anything did.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, what is in most cases the
strongest motive of all for the preservation of a
road was here entirely absent, and that is what
I have called the “potential” between the two
terminals. When there is a long and continued
motive for joining up two terminal points the
Road has a cause of survival superior to any
other. There was, and remains to this day, an
extremely strong “potential” of this kind
between the ports serving the Channel straits,
with their nucleus at Canterbury, and the<span id="Page_164" class="pagenum">[164]</span>
economic capital inland at London. It therefore,
as the Roman road between the one terminal
and the other, remained permanent throughout
the centuries, with the exception of the deflection
towards the Thames which grew up in
the Dark Ages to serve the landing places at
Gravesend. But such a “potential” is entirely
lacking for the north-western road communication&mdash;so
far as we know&mdash;to go between
London and Chester. The trade with Ireland
ceased almost during the early Dark Ages. The
north-western road led nowhere. If it was
preserved, therefore, as it <em>has</em> been preserved, it
must have been due to other causes which escape
us. There it runs, however, still almost uninterruptedly
used, from the Marble Arch in
London to Oakengates in Shropshire, and in
places still acts as part of the main artery leading
from south-east to north-west.</p>


<h3>v</h3>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">Stane Street.</span> The Stane Street (which
I must be excused for quoting so continuously
as I know it in great detail) is, I think, the leading
example of a road still remaining for the
most part and clearly showing how the later
systems were built up upon a Roman backbone.</p>

<p>I will take the liberty of recapitulating here
my argument, developed at greater length in
my monograph on this Way. The original<span id="Page_165" class="pagenum">[165]</span>
motive of the Stane Street was the connecting
of the Chichester Harbours, and indirectly of
Portsmouth Harbour, with London by a road
which should overcome the difficulties of the
Weald. The Weald is a mass of stiff clay, impassable
to general traffic for six months of the
year unless one uses artificial means. Left to
itself it turns rapidly into a waste of oak and
thorn scrub: save in the dry months, there is no
going over it in its natural state for armies or
bodies of wheeled vehicles. Its watercourses
are numerous, muddy, difficult of approach, and
soft at bottom. It produces nothing save in
moments of high civilization, when it can be
heavily capitalized by draining and penetrated
by expensive artificial communications. The
supply of good water is rare and capricious.
The Weald was, therefore, the great obstacle
between the south coast and the Thames.
Because it was such an obstacle the Romans
drove their first great road from the main harbour
of Portsmouth to the capital round westward
by Winchester, Silchester, and Staines;
but they needed a supplementary road, for two
reasons. First, they wanted a short cut to serve
Portsmouth and the lesser inlets collectively
called Chichester Harbours (Bosham appears to
have been an official port throughout the Dark
Ages); and, secondly, they wanted to be able to
reach quickly for purposes of travel and commerce<span id="Page_166" class="pagenum">[166]</span>
the very fertile sea plain of which
Chichester is the capital. Therefore did they
construct the most purely military and most
direct of all the Roman roads in the island, the
Stane Street. It ran from the east gate of
Chichester in a direct line to the crossing of the
Arun at Pulborough, with a camp at the end of
this first day’s march to defend it; thence it
made in another great straight limb for the
shoulder of Leith Hill, with a camp at the second
crossing of the upper Arun at Romans Wood;
thence by a series of much shorter limbs to the
third camp at Dorking; thence over the Mole
at Burford Bridge and over the Epsom Downs
past the racecourse to the fourth camp at Merton,
and thence to London Bridge&mdash;a five-march
stage.</p>

<p>In the Dark Ages the Weald became impassable
again, the causeway on the Arun
marshes broke down and was swallowed up.
The bridge at Alfoldean broke down, and
Sussex was isolated from the north.</p>

<p>Further, with the absence of any exit for
direct and rapid communication between Chichester
and London the meaning went out of
the road between Dorking and Merton. Merton
was close enough to London to give the
road vitality again, and between this and
London it was never lost. It runs to this day,
and is the main line of tramways upon which<span id="Page_167" class="pagenum">[167]</span>
people still travel from Streatham and Balham
to the Borough. It is only deflected at the end
by the intricacies of the Southwark streets.</p>

<p><a href="#Part_II_Sketch_XI">Now, if you look at the present scheme of
roads surrounding this original Roman core</a>
they look at first as though they had no connection
with it, but when you examine them in
detail the way in which they grew up out of
the Roman road is clear. Every deflection can
be accounted for, and the development of the
local systems from the original continuous backbone
becomes evident.</p>

</div>

<p>First you have all Sussex south of Pulborough
Marsh, and again south of Alfoldean Bridge,
isolated.</p>

<p>What happens?</p>

<p>There remained no reason for using the
Stane Street as a continuous line. It now
led nowhere. When it meets with its first
great obstacle going north, the woods near
Eartham, it makes for the next centre of
population&mdash;Petworth, where there was a fortified
post going back to some very early time.
The wood deflects the road towards Duncton
Hill (I have quoted this example in my section
on vegetation in the earlier part of this essay).
Beyond Petworth it had little function, so this
first ten miles of the Stane Street becomes the
parent of the local Chichester-Petworth road
which grew up out of it, leaving a gap where the<span id="Page_168" class="pagenum">[168]</span>
woods intervened. Next you must note the
local roads beyond this gap. Pulborough Bridge
probably survived, but the causeway could not
be kept up, or was ill kept up. In its original
line, when it served the camp at Hardham, it<span id="Page_169" class="pagenum">[169]</span>
ran over a wide part of the marsh. In the Dark
Ages men picked their way over the narrowest
part of the marsh and then followed the hard
bank above the Arun-flooded levels, linking up
the villages as far as Bignor. But there the use
of the road ended. The “potential” was from
Pulborough to the nearest seaport, which was
then Arundel. And all that the Roman road
did in this section was to throw out this bow or
curve of lateral road eastward between Pulborough
and Bignor, the line of main local
travel being diverted from Bury over Arundel
Hill and so seaward.</p>

<p>In the section north of Pulborough the
Roman road still served a few scattered homesteads
in the Dark Ages up to Billingshurst at
least, but again it led nowhere because the
bridge at Romans Wood was broken down and
the high weald beyond was a mass of scrub
growing on stiff clay. The road petered out and
began again with harder going near Ockley.
But it was not used over the shoulder of Leith
Hill, because that trace subserved no local use
and yet compelled the traveller to steep
gradients. Travel was deflected round the base
of the hills to Dorking, linking up the more
populated part where the water springs were.
This new trace, growing up obviously out of the
Roman road, opens up to the eastward for a
mile or two of the way until it joins up in the<span id="Page_170" class="pagenum">[170]</span>
heart of Dorking itself, where the third camp
was, out of which the town of Dorking has
grown, and where in the churchyard the Roman
road can still be traced passing through. From
Dorking onwards one might have imagined
that it would have survived all the way to
London. Why did it not do so?</p>

<p>It was a matter of gradients and of centres of
population. In the Dark Ages, when there was
little necessity for making a direct line between
Dorking and London&mdash;no continual marching
of great Roman forces, no conveying of orders
from a centralized government&mdash;men took the
easier way. They abandoned the up-and-down
of the spur of land lying immediately north of
Dorking and went round by its base to save the
trouble of the little climb. They used the
Roman bridge (which apparently survived at
Burford), but the very steep leap up on to the
Epsom Downs they abandoned, especially as
the further progress of the road over the chalk
connected no centres of population. The way
curled round by Michelham and Leatherhead
and came round to Epsom&mdash;all places suitable
for centres of population with low water levels
and no heavy gradients in between. The
Roman road on the high waterless chalk above
was left abandoned.</p>

<p>What happened between Epsom and Merton
has been already described. There is only one<span id="Page_173" class="pagenum">[173]</span>
divergence in this section, which is where the
road of the Dark Ages deflected somewhat to
the left and was used to avoid the low wet
ground below Clapham Common. For the rest
it maintained its use.</p>

<div id="Ref_171" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ermine Street

</div>

<p>(3) The best example I know, as I have said,
of a Roman road the evidences of which have
nearly disappeared, but round which local roads
have grown and which can still be identified as
the core of these, is the short cut between Penkridge
and Chester. It is very puzzling why the
Roman road should here have disappeared. It
is perhaps best to be explained by the continual
fighting between the Eastern and the
Western troops, which must have ravaged all
that country between the first of the raids and
the full conversion of England to civilization
and the Christian religion which was the work
of the seventh century.</p>

<p>But, whatever the cause or circumstances, the
phenomenon is quite plain. The local roads
developed for purely local purposes on either
side of the original Roman line, and that line,
since there is no longer required any continuous
traffic along it, disappears.</p>


<h3>vi</h3>

<p>(4) Lastly, we have the Peddars Way. It has
presented a very difficult problem to all historians,
but I think a solution is to be guessed at,<span id="Page_174" class="pagenum">[174]</span>
though not to be too strongly affirmed. The
Peddars Way runs as a main artery right
through Suffolk and Norfolk. Its origin was
clearly Stratford St. Mary’s, on the southern
edge of Suffolk, and it was built to link up that
water crossing with some harbour now disappeared
on the Wash. Its use has dropped out;
local roads are only concerned with it in a short
section, and men argue thus: why was it ever
made, and, if made, why did it fail as a means
of communication? I think the answer is military.
The Peddars Way never linked up any
centres of population. It goes through land
where men have never built cities or even large
villages. But what it would do as a military
road, what I think it was designed to do, was the
holding of all that solid block of East Anglia
which apparently exactly corresponds with the
territory of the Iceni. For we must remember,
as I have said above, that our county system is
probably Roman in origin, and most of it
corresponds to tribal divisions earlier even than
the Roman administration. It is a point that
has often been denied, but those who deny it
fail to remark the analogy of the Continent,
the evidence of Kent, Sussex, Dorsetshire,
and Essex, apart from the striking list of
that mass of counties which all centre round
a Roman town or a town grown up as the
suburb of a Roman town&mdash;Leicestershire,<span id="Page_175" class="pagenum">[175]</span>
Worcestershire, Huntingdonshire, Gloucestershire,
etc.</p>

<p>The Peddars Way cuts right across East
Anglia through its very centre, so that a chain
of stations along it commands the whole territory.
It further divides that territory into two&mdash;a
territory which was the scene of a great revolt
in the beginning of the Roman occupation. It
continued to subserve a certain function to the
very end, because from it as a base one can
radiate to threatened points upon the coast
when the pirate raids began in the middle of the
Roman occupation.</p>

<p>When, in the Dark Ages, the whole island
fell into districts, fighting one against the other,
each with its local king, the whole a chaos and a
welter, the Peddars Way entirely lost its meaning
and value. There was no longer one government
or one army. There was no need for the
controlling of a subject populace, for the populace
had ceased to be subject save to its local
chiefs. Such few men as still came over the
North Sea were not, until the Danish invasion,
enemies, and as the Peddars Way served no line
of villages or of towns it fell completely out of
use.</p>

<p>There is one very curious puzzle about this
famous road, and which has never been settled,
and to which I offer no more than an attempt at
solution. We are fairly certain that one of the<span id="Page_176" class="pagenum">[176]</span>
great Roman stations for the repelling of raids
lay at Brancaster, upon the Wash. Yet the
Peddars Way does not make for Brancaster, but
for a point about four miles to the east along the
coast. Why is this? There has been suggested
a ferry across the Wash, but that hypothesis
cannot be entertained. The distance is one of
eleven miles over very difficult water, and leading
to no important district. We have, I think,
the key to the position in the presence of a harbour
which has been destroyed by erosion. All
that coast has been modified perpetually during
the last two thousand years through the vagaries
of the sea. Of the great harbours of the
Middle Ages, Dunwich to the south has disappeared,
Orford is blocked and is decayed.
Yarmouth, on the other hand, has grown up
from a shingle bank into a town, and Breydon
Water has changed from an estuary into a
land-locked broad. I cannot doubt that there
was some harbour at the end of the Peddars
Way which the sea has destroyed. Brancaster,
the military post, was established near
it, but not actually within its confines, for
some local reason, the character of which we
have now lost. We must remember that Brancaster
is a late fortification and the Peddars
Way was settled before Brancaster came into
being.</p>

<p><span id="Page_177" class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>


<h3>vii</h3>

<p>We must imagine this process of gradual
local development continuing uninterruptedly
throughout the Dark Ages, the Roman roads
serving local purposes gradually ceasing to have
continuous use save for the Fosse Way, the
Watling Street, and one or two of the other
greater roads: the local ways, very ill maintained,
growing up out of the Roman system.
When the Dark Ages came to an end, and when
the mediaeval civilization succeeded it&mdash;that is,
in the five great centuries between the Conquest
and the Reformation&mdash;this new system of local
ways was hardened and became the national
system which we still inherit.</p>

<p>When I say the mediaeval system I mean the
system which must have had its origin, or, at
any rate, its mainspring, in the twelfth century,
and which substituted for the use of the decayed
Roman roads a competing system of roads no
longer identical with them, though originally
based upon them as a framework.</p>

<p>Here again we have no direct records, but we
have indirect evidence sufficient for our purpose.
The twelfth century was the moment
when civilization was arising again everywhere
throughout the west, and nowhere more strongly
than Britain. That was true of the architecture
and town life and education, and of letters, and,
we may justly presume, of the road system as well.</p>

<p><span id="Page_178" class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>Again, from that date onwards you begin to
get sites unconnected with the old Roman road
system, and their number increases rapidly as
the Middle Ages advance. Again, we learn
from any amount of evidence the comparative
rapidity of travel after the Dark Ages, and that
even over roads which certainly were not
Roman. We can trace it in the marching of
armies, the transport of grain and other provisions,
and the travel of individuals.</p>

<p>We may take almost any district in England
and discover for ourselves by a little study how
the mediaeval road system, which continued to
develop until the change in its use by the turnpike,
grew up out of the Roman Road, and we
can thus show how the Roman road system is at
the foundation of all our English ways.</p>

<p>There was no regular plan or order in all
this. Local usage, local necessity developed the
tortuous network, and has left its stamp upon
the face of England.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The next great change came with the
change in local government to which I
have alluded. It gave us the first Acts of
Parliament, taking the place of the old customary
upkeep of the roads, but acting, oddly
enough, at a period during which the road was
declining everywhere. Even the civil wars did
little to amend what had become a badly
decayed scheme of communication.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this was that the great
arm of the civil wars was the cavalry, and cavalry
is not tied to roads as infantry is. Another and
better reason was the comparatively small numbers
engaged.</p>

<p>The civil wars loom large in our political<span id="Page_180" class="pagenum">[180]</span>
history because they marked the destruction of
the monarchy and the beginning of aristocratic
government, but in military history they are no
very great affair: a sort of local epilogue to the
Thirty Years’ War and the great religious
struggle upon the Continent.</p>

<p>What <em>did</em> make a difference was the sudden
increase of wheeled traffic with the end of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of exaggeration
in this matter. Sundry historians have written
as though wheeled traffic were unknown until
very modern times. That, of course, is nonsense.
But the distinctive mark of the later
seventeenth century and early eighteenth was
the gradual substitution of ordinary passenger
traffic by wheel instead of on horseback. The
public vehicle comes in much at the same time
as the private vehicle, developed by the new
great landlord class for their convenience in
their country rounds. As has been the case with
the internal combustion engine in our own
time, the instrument preceded the change in the
road. As wheeled traffic for passengers becomes
more common you get increasing complaints
on the condition of the roads and increasing
motive for improving them, and out of that
grows the <em>turnpike system</em>, which, with its later
development, has carried us on to the present
day.</p>

</div>

<p><span id="Page_183" class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Turnpike System</span>, by a process which
originated in small beginnings and ended with
a revolution in general communications, made
the modern English Road.</p>

<p>It sprang from that character in the economic
society of Britain (closely connected with the
new aristocratic government of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries) whereby, in the
destruction of the monarchy, individual action
became supreme.</p>

<p>The same force which had forbidden great
national roads to rise, to wit, the absence of a
central all-powerful authority (such as was the
French monarchy just over the Channel, with
its great roads planned and constructed throughout
the whole realm on one model)&mdash;which had
maintained local diversity and local usage and
kept back the proper development of the road&mdash;made
for a change which should be due to
private enterprise.</p>

<p>We all know of what value this individualist
and aristocratic economic system was to the
expansion of English trade overseas, and how it
is at the foundation of what is to-day called
“the Empire.” In domestic affairs it meant, of
course, the sacrifice of the interests of the community
to a comparatively small wealthy class,
but that did not prevent this wealthy class from
acting very efficiently under the opportunity<span id="Page_184" class="pagenum">[184]</span>
for gain within its own sphere. The mass of
Englishmen became, and have remained, impoverished,
but the total wealth of the country
and its population have vastly increased.</p>

<p>The idea of the turnpike was to give a small
body of capitalists the right to exploit certain
sections of road. They would improve the surface
and broaden the gauge where necessary,
etc., but they would put up gates where they
could charge for the passage of all and sundry
and thus earn the interest upon their money.
They had also powers to borrow. They had
certain powers for using the public rates, etc.,
and in general, through this system, the roads
of the country were more and more given over
to what we call to-day capitalist exploitation:
for although very often the sections of road thus
exploited were short they formed an interruption
to general travel.</p>

<p>Popular resentment against such an innovation
was, of course, bitter, especially when it
extended to large areas. There were periods of
riot in which the toll-gates were destroyed, and
there was something like a little civil war in the
matter in South Wales, but the interests of the
wealthier class were supreme, the populace was
suppressed, and the system continued. It also
vastly extended.</p>

<p>While it had the social disadvantages just
mentioned, it had the economic advantage of<span id="Page_185" class="pagenum">[185]</span>
creating bit by bit longer and longer sections of
really good road up and down the country. To
the turnpike system we owe that development
of the English roads which made English coaching
and gave us, in the generation before and
during the Napoleonic wars, on the whole, the
best system of local communications in Europe,
though we still grievously lacked <em>continuous</em>
national communications between distant centres.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>The date to which must be referred the great
change in this respect&mdash;the date from which we
must count the growth of general national communications
continuous throughout the island&mdash;is
the year 1810. The turnpike system did
indeed die slowly and only much later. It
lingered on to well within living memory, and
those who are curious to watch the rise and
decay of institutions may even argue that some
relics of it remain among us still. But in
practice 1810 is the date of the first experimental
change which was ultimately to produce
the road system of to-day.</p>

<p>If we consider the use and character of the
Road, its texture and appearance, its effect
upon the landscape, its connection with society
as distinct from the legislation connected with it,
1810 is much more of a pivotal date than such<span id="Page_186" class="pagenum">[186]</span>
dates as 1555 or 1822, which mark the political
changes in the statutory powers of dealing
with roads. Already stage coaches driven from
the box, and every year increasing the rate of
travel, had been upon the road for a generation&mdash;for
twenty-six years; and already great
lengths of turnpike trust roads had come to a
sufficient excellence of surface to permit travel
at an average rate over those branches of ten
miles an hour. But, as I have said, there was not
as yet <em>one continuous piece of road designed to
connect two important termini, of equal value
throughout, and ordered in all its length towards
that one end of making equable and rapid transit
possible between the two extremities</em>. That is the
point. The thing had not existed in this island
(save in the “four Regal Ways”) since the
breakdown of the Roman central government in
the fifth century.</p>

<p>What happened in 1810, and what makes it
such a memorable date, is the appointment,
under the pressure of the Postmaster-General,
of a stonemason who had risen to the practice
of road engineering&mdash;Thomas Telford&mdash;to the
overlooking of the Holyhead Road.</p>

<p>The initiative came from the Post Office
Department: the administrative and engineering
genius came from Telford. Incidentally,
we should remark, as one of the innumerable
examples of unforeseen and exceedingly important<span id="Page_187" class="pagenum">[187]</span>
side developments in history, the fact
that this great revolution in British roads
ultimately derived from Pitt’s Act of Union
with Ireland, which was already nine years old.
It was the necessity of communication between
London and Holyhead, and especially of postal
communication, which did the business.</p>

<p>Telford had been in the employment for
some years past of the Highland Roads Commission.
He had therefore proved his capacity,
and from it he was appointed to a Government
position in the re-establishment of the Holyhead
Road after the affair had been examined by a
Parliamentary Committee in this year (1810).
It was not only Telford’s skill, it was still more
his energy and intense application to detail
which wrought the change. His nominal
masters were ten Commissioners and three
Ministers at their head; his real chief was
Parnell, later Lord Congleton. But it was
Telford, by his ceaseless travelling and investigation
and overlooking of everything, who
pushed the thing through.</p>

<p>The whole distance to be reorganized was one
of 194 miles. Of this the larger part, 109 miles,
fell under seventeen English Trusts; the remaining
85 miles were under six Welsh Trusts, the
latter with far less local traffic to provide them
with income, and, it would seem, also of less
general efficiency.</p>

<p><span id="Page_188" class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>Telford’s task may be appreciated when we
remember that the new policy gave him no
direct statutory power to override trusts.
Each one had to be argued with, bargained
with, and persuaded. This at least was true of
the English Trusts and the six Welsh Trusts.
The Commissioners, or rather Telford and
Parnell, despaired. The trusts controlled so very
much the larger part of the trajectory that it was
necessary in some way to dispose of them.</p>

<p>More than seven years passed before this
could be done. But Parnell succeeded in persuading
them, by industrious attendance before
various meetings, to accept an Act of Parliament
which cast them all into one body of
fifteen, and they were, by statute, compelled to
employ a professional civil engineer, who was,
of course, Telford. The 85 remaining miles were
taken over, scientifically divided into sections
under assistant surveyors and foremen below
them, and by 1830, after the labour of twenty
years, the whole thing was done. A suspension
bridge had been thrown over the Menai
Straits, Holyhead Harbour had been improved.
These, with the reconstruction of the road, had
drawn from Parliament grants of three-quarters
of a million. From that moment there existed
at least one complete road in Britain, uniting two
definite termini and everywhere making possible
the rapid travel at the time. The tolls were, of<span id="Page_189" class="pagenum">[189]</span>
course, maintained. Their cost was increased by
one-half. The anomalies, complexities, and
corruptions involved in the system were no
more done away with on the Holyhead Road
than on any other, except in so far as a
closer supervision helped to alleviate things and
in so far as amalgamation of trusts also helped.
But, at any rate, there was at least one continuous
and excellent road from the capital to
a distant port, and we have the date 1830 for the
completion of the great task which was begun
in 1810.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>Contemporary with this first great complete
model of a road in England went the movement
connected with the name of Macadam. It was
far less of a revolution than has since been
represented. The Continent had made experiments
similar to those of Macadam long before
him, and what he effected over here was no
more than an improvement, for it was not
wholly novel.</p>

<p>The real point of Macadam in our road history
is his intense devotion to his task. He was
one of those men who, having seen clearly a
principle which others have also seen, and
which, indeed, should be obvious, so emphasizes
it and represents it that he brings it into practice
where other men would have abandoned it. The<span id="Page_190" class="pagenum">[190]</span>
obvious principle which Macadam grasped and
reiterated to weariness was the principle that
perpetual legislation and experiment in the type
of vehicle best suited to a road was of less importance
than the surface and weight-carrying
capacity of the Road. Get the best road you can
first, and after that discuss the traffic along it.
In certain technical details posterity has criticized
it&mdash;in its insufficient allowance of foundation,
for instance; in its postulate that a well-drained
natural surface was sufficient to bear
anything in the way of road traction. Such
criticism can only be conducted by experts, but
it is certainly true that Macadam transformed
the surface of the English Road, not perhaps by
any special or novel conception of his own
either in the material or in the sizes of that
material, but rather in the unique insistence
with which he carried on his whole task.</p>

<p>Just as the Post Office had been the Government
department for using Telford, so the
Board of Works was the Government department
backing Macadam.</p>

<p>These two men between them, and these two
departments between them, had remade the
English Road, and the system was fairly launched
towards such a change as would perhaps have
given us a completely transformed road system,
the value of which we should have appreciated
when the new traffic of the internal combustion<span id="Page_191" class="pagenum">[191]</span>
engine presented us with the problems of the
present day.</p>

<p>For instance, Telford himself had suggested&mdash;and
there was nearly achieved&mdash;a reformed
stretch of the Great North Road between Peterborough
and York on a straight line, avoiding
the windings of the old trace, and twenty
miles shorter: worthy to rank in every way
with the great roads of the Continent. This,
had it been realized, might well have proved
only the first of a great number of similar
constructions, until we should have had all
the great centres of England united in the same
fashion and a habit of broad, straight, and
excellent roads established. Unfortunately, a
great historical accident intervened to sidetrack
the whole business. It was an example
of the way in which the advantages of spontaneity
and inventiveness, making normally for
the benefit of the community as a whole, will,
if there is no central direction, do incidental
hurt which has later to be repaired, if at all, at
great expense of energy. The reason we have
to-day the innumerable narrow winding roads
of England, the lack of any general system, the
absence of any system of good roads from London
to the ports (to this day half the exits from
London are blocked by absurd “bottle necks,”
the most notorious of which, of course, is that
on the West road, which is now at last being<span id="Page_192" class="pagenum">[192]</span>
remedied), is that the English genius produced
the locomotive.</p>


<h3>v</h3>

<p>Stephenson’s great revolution was begun in
1829. The great Holyhead Road was completed
in 1830. The coincidence of dates is
significant. England developed immediately an
immense system of railways. Not only was she
twenty years ahead of the rest of the world in
the business, but she alone, for a long time,
could produce railways. The railways on the
Continent had to be built often by English
engineers and always upon an English model.
The transformation which this effected in the
national life was so rapid that it warped judgment.
Men began to talk as though the road
would fall out of use. It was the same sort of
exaggeration as led people about ten years ago
to tell us that shortly horses would no longer
be seen in the streets of London or even on the
country roads.</p>

<p>The introduction of the railway had two
deplorable effects upon the economic life of
England, each of which was grave, and one of
which we must, if we can, immediately remedy
on peril of decline. Neither of them can be
remedied save at a new expense of energy:
(1) It killed the canals, (2) It killed all the
schemes for widening, straightening, and rebuilding<span id="Page_193" class="pagenum">[193]</span>
the national road system; while upon
the Continent, and especially in France, the great
broad, straight roads of the eighteenth century
formed the model continuously applied, so that
the most recent examples to-day are in the
same tradition as those of two hundred years
ago and yet amply fulfil their function. Here
the whole story of our roads from the middle
and the end of the nineteenth century and on
to the beginning of this century is the story of
improving the surface while keeping to the
old winding and narrowness. Here and there we
have had extensions of space which create really
new roads in the neighbourhood of towns,
especially as exits from towns, but nowhere as yet
have we a complete scheme for the remodelling
of a road in the fashion whereby, a century ago,
the great Holyhead Road was remodelled.</p>

of the Land Contiguous to the New Roads.</em></p>


<h3>i</h3>

<p class="dropcap">We have come to the point where some
great initiative is imperatively needed
for the re-establishment of communications
corresponding to modern needs.</p>

<p>But while all feel this, no one as yet has,
I believe, thought out the main elements of the
scheme. We cannot remake all the ways of
England, nor even change the main part of
them to suit the new kind of traffic. We have
been “taken aback,” as they say in sailing, and
“caught all standing.” Our charming, narrow,
hedged, tortuous lanes, our haphazard county
communications, even our main ways, have suddenly
proved grossly inapt to the new traffic;
and our towns, unaffected by the great Continental
movement (which I have heard called
the “boulevard” movement) of the middle
nineteenth century, are in the same case. If we
cannot&mdash;and obviously we cannot&mdash;remodel
the whole thing, what <em>can</em> we do?</p>

<p><span id="Page_195" class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>So far as I can see, we can proceed upon
certain main principles, with which I propose
to conclude.</p>

<p>I distinguish between the problem of the
street traffic in the towns, with which I am not
concerned, and that of the main road. As it
seems to me, what we need is, and that immediately,
a certain number&mdash;quite a large number&mdash;of
great arterial roads very broad and
straight with a special surface, confined to
motor traffic alone.</p>

<p>These, including circular ways round the
towns to avoid the present unnecessary and congested
passage through the towns, would act as
ditches act in a fen. They would gather
towards them the main streams of traffic, as such
ditches gather towards them and drain the
moisture of a fen. That having been done, the
remaining difficulties upon the by-roads would
be cut down to a quarter or less of their present
evil.</p>

<p>I will develop this.</p>


<h3>ii</h3>

<p>It is clear that our new vehicle, the internal
combustion engine, will compel us to new roads,
just as the vehicular traffic for passengers at the
beginning of the seventeenth century compelled
the creation of the turnpike. Far-seeing
men grasped this the moment that the internal<span id="Page_196" class="pagenum">[196]</span>
combustion engine appeared in our lives. I have
myself heard the details of an idea which very
nearly materialized and which was on the point
of becoming law&mdash;an experimental road to be
driven from one great centre to another, to be
reserved entirely to the new traffic and to be
made specially for these new necessities. Private
interest defeated the scheme, and in my opinion
that defeat was a very bad thing for the general
development of the country. But though the
first attempt failed, the very fruitful and sensible
idea underlying it is worth describing.</p>

<p>A very few great arterial roads joining up
the main centres of population would have far
more effect upon our present difficulties than
their mere mileage would seem to warrant. There
could be no question of stopping the new form
of traffic upon the ordinary roads remaining,
which in length might be twenty or fifty times
those of the new roads. But it would be of such
advantage for long-distance travel to use the
great arteries that at the expenditure of greater
mileage <em>you would find the new traffic seeking
them at the nearest point upon one side and clinging
to them for as long as possible</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose, for the sake of hypothesis, a simple
case. Suppose a great arterial road to be built
joining the heart of London and the heart of
Birmingham in a straight line: it would pass
just by Tring and Buckingham and then on<span id="Page_197" class="pagenum">[197]</span>
through the gap between Leamington and Warwick.
A man living at Windsor and desiring
to reach Coventry, and using the new method of
fast travel, would seek this main road at its
nearest point and leave it again at the nearest
point to his terminus. It would be a less
picturesque, but a much safer and quicker way
of doing his business. It would add a dozen miles
to his total trajectory, but it would save a much
more than corresponding amount of strain and
expense of energy in following the series of
narrow and winding roads most nearly connecting
the two points. The same would be
true of any other trajectory not directly served
by the new roads. The advantage of safe and
rapid travel on a first-class surface of very broad
gauge, free of horses and pedestrians, would
make people take a “Z” to include as much as
possible of such a road rather than cling to the
shorter line.</p>

<p>The final effect would be the relief of congestion
upon the typically narrow winding
roads which cover the surface of England. They
would be relieved, in the case we have quoted,
not only of the great mass of urban traffic between
London and Birmingham; they would be
also relieved of the very considerable local traffic&mdash;not
entirely relieved, of course, but relieved in
a proportion large enough to make a very sensible
difference to modern communications.</p>

<p><span id="Page_198" class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>Though the thing still remains pure theory
and though the political and social obstacles to
it are very serious indeed (any trajectory you
name in this crowded island would destroy
much which all our people&mdash;let alone the
owners&mdash;love to preserve), yet it is worth while
to analyse the conditions of such roads, because
only thus can we establish the main rules which,
under whatever modification, must ultimately
govern the change that should come.</p>


<h3>iii</h3>

<p>We need five things:</p>

<p>(1) A very strong foundation, upon which
depends&mdash;</p>

<p>(2) A permanently good surface;</p>

<p>(3) The avoidance of sudden curves (in
which is included the avoidance of obstacles
hiding the approaches to any curve);</p>

<p>(4) Great width;</p>

<p>(5) A fifth point, almost as important as these
first four, the necessity for the providing of
crossings. The great arterial road reserved to
the internal combustion engine would be, for
people who had to cross it, an obstacle a great
deal worse than a railway. Our forefathers protected
in all sorts of fashions the road crossing
the railway at a level crossing&mdash;by insisting on
gates and an attendant, by compelling the road,
if possible, to pass above the railway upon a<span id="Page_199" class="pagenum">[199]</span>
bridge, and so on. More attention was paid to
this point in England than in any Continental
country, and we benefit by the results of that
care to-day. But the arterial road would be far
more dangerous. It would have a continual
stream of very rapid vehicles in both directions,
and the scheme had better not be envisaged at
all if the cost of providing for cross traffic is not
faced. The problem is by no means an easy
one. It means, necessarily, embankments for
bridges, or tunnelling, at <em>every</em> crossing, and
these will have to be more numerous than the
road crossings: they will have to serve rights of
way and private approaches as well. I think it
will be found, when the scheme is first
attempted, that this obstacle will prove the
most serious of all.</p>

<p>It is for experts in the science (of which I
know nothing, and allusion to which I have
therefore kept carefully out of this essay) to
decide what these details of surface, width,
foundation, etc., mean in practice: their expense
and character.</p>

<p>They know from experiments made what
materials and foundation may be best, what
minimum width suggests itself (I have occasionally
heard the minimum width of 100 feet
suggested); but whatever the detailed practice,
when the experts set to work on the new motor
roads it must be with these five main provisions<span id="Page_200" class="pagenum">[200]</span>
before them. There are minor considerations.
You have, with the new traffic, to
consider a gradient somewhere between the old
road gradient and the railway gradient. There,
again, it is for experts to determine what the
maximum useful gradient should be. The
trouble in our present road system is that in any
trajectory you will have one or two places where
the new traffic is perilous. There are even
exceptional points in England where it is almost
prohibited by excessive gradients.</p>

<p>Another point in connection with such great
arterial roads is the capital one of exit from the
great urban centres. It is of little use to relieve
traffic, to diminish the strain and expense of
energy connected with it, and the peril, and all
the rest of it, between two urban centres
if the exit and entry from and into each are
blocked.</p>

<p>Now, the trouble here is a purely economic
trouble. Urban sites have a special value, even
in the outskirts. They are not, as a rule, sites
to which anyone is attached, but the cost of
buying them up has made reformers hesitate to
drive the arterial ways which are so urgently
needed. Once your great road has reached the
inner ring of a large town its traffic disperses and
there is no need for continuing its dimensions.
But the new system can be of no real service if,
on the approach to a great town, we retain<span id="Page_201" class="pagenum">[201]</span>
the narrows and guts which disfigure, for
example, the western road out of London. It
might even be said that from the political standpoint
it would be better to begin with the
assurance of good exits and entrances than with
the planning of the Road as a whole.</p>

<p>At present we have, in the particular case of
London, one, and only one, good entry.
That is the entry from the north-west. All the
others are hopelessly congested.</p>


<h3>iv</h3>

<p>There will occur in connection with all this
discussion of the necessity for a modern change
in the Road the point of ways and means.
Somebody must pay. How shall the payment
be made? It has already become a matter of
politics. Pretty well all that can be said upon
it has been said, but as yet there is no agreement.
I would maintain (very tentatively, hardly as
more than a suggestion) that we shall never get
a satisfactory settlement until we found ourselves
upon three main principles:</p>

<p>(1) The making of a few great arteries,
coupled with the making of proper exits from
the great towns and of by-ways round the urban
centres, is a national concern. You cannot, in
the present state of society, regard it as local,
nor even as chiefly concerning the direct users
of the Road, for even these, who are apparently<span id="Page_202" class="pagenum">[202]</span>
the people upon whom the burden should most
justly fall, develop by their travel the district
through which they pass.</p>

<p>I suggest, therefore, that you must start in
this case with the fundamental principle of a
national fund, and a national fund not proceeding
from ear-marked receipts alone, but also
drawn from general taxes.</p>

<p>(2) The second principle which I should
suggest is that in so far as you tax travel for the
purposes of this fund you should tax it not by
any complicated combination of weight, power,
fuel, and so forth, but through some one factor
alone, otherwise you will be perpetually remodelling
your scheme and as perpetually
causing a grievance.</p>

<p>Now, the most obvious factor is fuel. One way
and another, the fuel a man uses for his machine
is the nearest test to the use he makes of the Road.
A heavy weight needs more fuel, great speed
and consequently greater wear and tear needs
more fuel, and greater horse-power needs more
fuel. The curves are, of course, not parallel.
You can get equal speeds between heavy and
light for nearly the same consumption of fuel.
One type of machine will do more harm to the
road surface for every gallon of fuel than
another, and so on. But if you want to have
easy revenue simplicity in taxation is vital:
surely the taxation of fuel is the simplest and<span id="Page_203" class="pagenum">[203]</span>
most direct method. It is easily collected. It
does away with all chance of confusion. It can
be imposed at source and in bulk, and it has that
invaluable quality which has been often lost
sight of in the last two generations: that it is
paid gradually and at will and yet paid inevitably.
So long, of course, as a false distinction
is maintained between the commercial
and the private use of vehicles you will have
gross anomalies and injustice. To draw the line
between economic waste in the use of the modern
internal combustion engine and what is part of
the general and normal life of the community
is impossible. It would be better were the distinction
to be wholly removed. We do not ask
a man who takes a ticket from Birmingham to
London whether he is going for fun or folly,
for business or necessity. Men pay the same
price for the ticket whatever the motive of their
journey. It is an absurd anomaly as things now
stand that the man who travels in a little Ford
car from one town to another with, say, two
members of his family&mdash;and travels therefore
much more cheaply than he could upon the
railway&mdash;should pay the rent of a house for the
privilege of having his car, while the heavy
vehicle of a tradesman who is distributing
advertising matter&mdash;sheer economic loss to
the community&mdash;should tear up the road for
nothing.</p>

<p><span id="Page_204" class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>(3) The grant for the new roads should include
the purchase, if not of a continuous belt along
each side, at least of blocks of land, especially
in the neighbourhood of existing communications,
near railway stations, near villages or
other centres now established, etc. The price
to be determined by arbitration upon the old
price basis before the scheme of the Road was
developed. If this were done the great difficulty
for <em>certain</em> purposes (not residential, but other)
of using these sites would accrue to the public
purse and would gradually relieve the cost of
construction.</p>

<p>This project touches, of course, upon one of
those political theories which have been debated,
as have all political theories in our time, with
too much violence and with too much generality.
If it be contended that we here introduce
the principle of the “single tax” and of the
nationalization of land, I can only say that
nothing is further either from my thoughts in
this essay or from my general politics&mdash;as any
number of my public pronouncements suffice to
prove. But we have here a very special case.
These new roads, if we drive them (as we
ought to drive them soon) between the main
points of the island, will, unless some such
scheme is adopted, make a direct and immediate
present of millions to the chance owners of land
upon their trajectory. It would be a gross case<span id="Page_205" class="pagenum">[205]</span>
of actual endowment at the expense of the community.
Conversely, the reservation of land on
either side of the way for the purpose of helping
to pay for the new scheme would be of direct
advantage to the community and of disadvantage
to no one.</p>

<p>At any rate, just as we must soon have a
reform of the road system or suffer decline in
our communications and therefore in our
national life, so we must soon settle a reform in
the matter of road maintenance and road
taxation. For the new main arteries that should
be built we must depend upon the general resources
of the community, while for special
taxes upon traffic we must establish as soon as
possible a simple and universal system.</p>

<p>I need not add, for it is obvious, that such a
scheme of new roads would involve a certain
amount of individual hardship. It is impossible
to avoid that, but it is in the temper of this
nation to compromise closely and in detail upon
all such things. Nor need it be added that the
scheme would have to proceed by trial and
error, and could only be, at first, tentative and
applied experimentally to one or two chosen
trajectories. But I think that it is upon these
lines that the problem can be solved.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
